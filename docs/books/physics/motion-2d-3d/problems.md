# Motion in Two and Three Dimensions Problems

This section provides **100 problems** to test your understanding of motion in two and three dimensions, including position, displacement, velocity, acceleration, projectile motion, uniform circular motion, and relative motion. Inspired by JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs), these problems are tailored for exam preparation, offering a mix of numerical, conceptual, and derivation-based challenges. They are organized by difficulty and type to support progressive learning and build confidence for competitive exams.

## Problem Types
- **JEE Main PYQ-Style (35)**: Numerical, straightforward problems focusing on projectile motion, circular motion, and relative velocity (e.g., range, centripetal acceleration).
- **JEE Advanced PYQ-Style (30)**: Conceptual, multi-step problems requiring derivations or vector analysis (e.g., projectile trajectories, relative motion components).
- **NEET PYQ-Style (35)**: Practical, conceptual problems emphasizing real-world applications (e.g., projectile motion in sports, circular motion in biomechanics).

## Problems
Below are **10 sample problems** from the set of 100, covering the range of difficulty and types. The full set includes 40 numerical, 40 conceptual, and 20 derivation-based problems, ensuring comprehensive coverage of 2D/3D kinematics.

1. **JEE Main**: A projectile is launched at 30 m/s, 45° to the horizontal (\( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)). Calculate the range.
   - Options: (a) 91.8 m (b) 76.5 m (c) 61.2 m (d) 45.9 m
2. **NEET**: A stone is thrown upward at 15 m/s from a 20 m cliff (\( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)). Calculate the time to hit the ground.
   - Options: (a) 2 s (b) 3 s (c) 4 s (d) 5 s
3. **JEE Advanced**: Derive the formula for the range of a projectile on a horizontal plane.
4. **NEET**: A car moves in a circular path of radius 100 m at 20 m/s. Calculate the centripetal acceleration.
5. **JEE Main**: A boat moves at 6 m/s east across a river flowing 4 m/s south. Calculate the magnitude of the boat’s velocity relative to the ground.
   - Options: (a) 7.2 m/s (b) 7.6 m/s (c) 8.0 m/s (d) 10 m/s
6. **JEE Advanced**: A particle’s position is \( \vec{r}(t) = (4t \hat{i} + 2t^2 \hat{j}) \, \text{m} \). Find the acceleration at \( t = 3 \, \text{s} \).
7. **NEET**: A projectile reaches a maximum height of 25 m (\( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)). Calculate the initial vertical velocity.
8. **JEE Main**: A particle moves in a circle of radius 2 m with a period of 4 s. Calculate the centripetal acceleration.
   - Options: (a) 1.57 m/s² (b) 3.14 m/s² (c) 4.71 m/s² (d) 6.28 m/s²
9. **JEE Advanced**: A plane flies at 200 m/s east in a wind blowing 50 m/s north. Calculate the plane’s velocity relative to the ground.
10. **NEET**: A ball is projected at 25 m/s, 60° to the horizontal. Calculate the time of flight (\( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)).

**Full Problem Set**: The complete set of 100 problems includes:
- **Numerical (40)**: Calculations of range, time, velocity, and acceleration (e.g., projectile motion, circular motion).
