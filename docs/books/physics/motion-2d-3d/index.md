# Chapter 4: Motion in Two and Three Dimensions

Kinematics in two and three dimensions extends the study of motion to include paths beyond straight lines, such as curves, circles, and trajectories. This chapter explores position, displacement, velocity, and acceleration in 2D and 3D, along with projectile motion, uniform circular motion, and relative motion. These concepts are pivotal for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET, appearing in problems involving projectile trajectories, satellite orbits, and vehicle dynamics. With clear explanations, exam-focused examples, and robust problem-solving strategies, this chapter equips students to master complex motion scenarios in competitive exams, ensuring precision and conceptual depth.

## 4.1 Position and Displacement in 2D and 3D

### Position
Position in 2D is defined by coordinates \( (x, y) \), and in 3D by \( (x, y, z) \), relative to a chosen origin. Represented as a position vector \( \vec{r} = x \hat{i} + y \hat{j} \) (2D) or \( \vec{r} = x \hat{i} + y \hat{j} + z \hat{k} \) (3D), it locates an object in space. JEE/NEET problems often involve calculating position vectors for particles or objects in motion, such as in projectile motion.

**Solved Example**: A JEE problem gives a particle’s position at \( t = 0 \) as \( (2, 3) \, \text{m} \). Express the position vector in 2D.
- **Solution**: \( \vec{r} = x \hat{i} + y \hat{j} = 2 \hat{i} + 3 \hat{j} \, \text{m} \). This vector notation is common in JEE kinematics questions, setting the stage for displacement calculations.

### Displacement
Displacement, a vector, is the change in position: \( \Delta \vec{r} = \vec{r}_2 - \vec{r}_1 \). In 2D, \( \Delta \vec{r} = (x_2 - x_1) \hat{i} + (y_2 - y_1) \hat{j} \). Its magnitude is \( |\Delta \vec{r}| = \sqrt{(\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2} \). Displacement is critical in JEE/NEET for analyzing motion paths, such as in trajectories.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves a particle moving from \( (1, 2) \, \text{m} \) to \( (4, 6) \, \text{m} \). Calculate the displacement’s magnitude.
- **Solution**: \( \Delta \vec{r} = (4 - 1) \hat{i} + (6 - 2) \hat{j} = 3 \hat{i} + 4 \hat{j} \, \text{m} \). Magnitude \( |\Delta \vec{r}| = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{25} = 5 \, \text{m} \) (2 significant figures, April 14, 2025). This is a typical NEET displacement problem.

## 4.2 Velocity and Acceleration in 2D and 3D

### Velocity
Velocity in 2D/3D is a vector, with average velocity \( \vec{v}_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta \vec{r}}{\Delta t} \) and instantaneous velocity \( \vec{v} = \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} = \frac{dx}{dt} \hat{i} + \frac{dy}{dt} \hat{j} \) (2D). For JEE/NEET, velocity components are crucial in projectile motion (e.g., horizontal and vertical velocities). *University Physics* highlights applications in GPS navigation, where 3D velocity vectors ensure accurate positioning.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem gives a particle’s position as \( \vec{r}(t) = (2t^2 \hat{i} + 3t \hat{j}) \, \text{m} \). Find the velocity at \( t = 2 \, \text{s} \).
- **Solution**: \( \vec{v} = \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(2t^2 \hat{i} + 3t \hat{j}) = 4t \hat{i} + 3 \hat{j} \). At \( t = 2 \), \( \vec{v} = 4 \times 2 \hat{i} + 3 \hat{j} = 8 \hat{i} + 3 \hat{j} \, \text{m/s} \). This calculus-based question is common in JEE Advanced.

### Acceleration
Acceleration, the rate of change of velocity, is \( \vec{a}_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t} \) or \( \vec{a} = \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} \). In 2D, \( \vec{a} = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} \hat{i} + \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} \hat{j} \). JEE/NEET problems involve acceleration in projectile motion (e.g., gravity) or circular motion (e.g., centripetal acceleration).

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves a particle with velocity \( \vec{v} = (3t \hat{i} - 2t^2 \hat{j}) \, \text{m/s} \). Find the acceleration at \( t = 1 \, \text{s} \).
- **Solution**: \( \vec{a} = \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(3t \hat{i} - 2t^2 \hat{j}) = 3 \hat{i} - 4t \hat{j} \). At \( t = 1 \), \( \vec{a} = 3 \hat{i} - 4 \hat{j} \, \text{m/s}^2 \). This is a typical NEET kinematics question.

## 4.3 Projectile Motion

Projectile motion occurs when an object is launched with an initial velocity and moves under gravity’s influence (\( \vec{a} = -g \hat{j} \), \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)). Horizontal and vertical motions are independent:
- **Horizontal**: Constant velocity \( v_x = u \cos\theta \), displacement \( x = (u \cos\theta)t \).
- **Vertical**: Constant acceleration \( a_y = -g \), velocity \( v_y = u \sin\theta - gt \), displacement \( y = (u \sin\theta)t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2 \).
Key quantities include time of flight, range, and maximum height, heavily tested in JEE/NEET.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves a ball launched at 20 m/s, 30° to the horizontal (\( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)). Calculate the maximum height.
- **Solution**: Vertical initial velocity \( u_y = u \sin\theta = 20 \sin 30^\circ = 10 \, \text{m/s} \). At maximum height, \( v_y = 0 \). Use \( v_y^2 = u_y^2 + 2a_y y \): \( 0 = 10^2 + 2(-9.8)h \). Solving, \( h = \frac{100}{19.6} \approx 5.10 \, \text{m} \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025). This is a standard JEE projectile question.

## 4.4 Uniform Circular Motion

Uniform circular motion involves an object moving in a circle at constant speed, with centripetal acceleration \( \vec{a} = -\frac{v^2}{r} \hat{r} \) directed toward the center (radius \( r \), speed \( v \)). The magnitude is \( a = \frac{v^2}{r} \). JEE/NEET problems test centripetal acceleration and period (\( T = \frac{2\pi r}{v} \)). *University Physics* notes applications in satellite orbits, relevant for JEE Advanced.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves a car on a circular track (radius 50 m) at 10 m/s. Calculate the centripetal acceleration.
- **Solution**: \( a = \frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{10^2}{50} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (2 significant figures). This is a typical NEET circular motion question.

## 4.5 Relative Motion in 2D

Relative motion describes an object’s motion relative to another moving object. The relative velocity \( \vec{v}_{A/B} = \vec{v}_A - \vec{v}_B \) is the velocity of A relative to B. JEE/NEET problems involve relative velocity in scenarios like boats crossing rivers or aircraft in wind. Components are analyzed separately (e.g., x- and y-directions).

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves a boat moving at 5 m/s east relative to a river flowing 3 m/s south. Calculate the boat’s velocity relative to the ground.
- **Solution**: \( \vec{v}_{\text{boat}} = 5 \hat{i} \, \text{m/s} \), \( \vec{v}_{\text{river}} = -3 \hat{j} \, \text{m/s} \). Relative velocity \( \vec{v}_{\text{boat/ground}} = \vec{v}_{\text{boat}} - \vec{v}_{\text{river}} = 5 \hat{i} - (-3 \hat{j}) = 5 \hat{i} + 3 \hat{j} \, \text{m/s} \). Magnitude \( |\vec{v}| = \sqrt{5^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{34} \approx 5.83 \, \text{m/s} \) (3 significant figures). This is a classic JEE relative motion problem.

## Review & Summary
- **Position and Displacement**: Position vector \( \vec{r} = x \hat{i} + y \hat{j} \) (2D); displacement \( \Delta \vec{r} = \vec{r}_2 - \vec{r}_1 \).
- **Velocity and Acceleration**: \( \vec{v} = \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} \), \( \vec{a} = \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} \), with components in 2D/3D.
- **Projectile Motion**: Independent horizontal (constant velocity) and vertical (constant acceleration \( -g \)) motions; key equations for range, height, time.
- **Uniform Circular Motion**: Centripetal acceleration \( a = \frac{v^2}{r} \), period \( T = \frac{2\pi r}{v} \).
- **Relative Motion**: \( \vec{v}_{A/B} = \vec{v}_A - \vec{v}_B \), used in river-boat or wind-aircraft problems.
