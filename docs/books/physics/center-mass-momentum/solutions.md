### JEE Advanced-Style Conceptual Solutions
36. **Problem 36 (JEE Advanced)**: Explain why the center of mass of a system remains stationary if no external forces act, even if internal forces cause particles to move.
   - **Solution**: The center of mass (COM) velocity is \( \vec{v}_{\text{COM}} = \frac{\sum m_i \vec{v}_i}{\sum m_i} \). By Newton’s second law, \( \sum \vec{F}_{\text{ext}} = M \frac{d\vec{v}_{\text{COM}}}{dt} \). If \( \sum \vec{F}_{\text{ext}} = 0 \), then \( \frac{d\vec{v}_{\text{COM}}}{dt} = 0 \), so \( \vec{v}_{\text{COM}} \) is constant. Internal forces (e.g., between particles) are equal and opposite (Newton’s third law), canceling in the sum, so they don’t affect \( \vec{v}_{\text{COM}} \). Thus, the COM remains stationary or moves uniformly, even if particles move due to internal forces (e.g., an explosion).
     - **JEE Tip**: Focus on external forces for COM motion. Common error: Assuming internal forces affect COM velocity.

37. **Problem 37 (JEE Advanced)**: A system of two masses moves with a constant COM velocity. Discuss how internal forces affect individual particle motion but not the COM.
   - **Solution**: Internal forces, such as tension or gravitational attraction between two masses, follow Newton’s third law (\( \vec{F}_{1 \text{ on } 2} = -\vec{F}_{2 \text{ on } 1} \)). These forces cause individual particles to accelerate (e.g., masses oscillating toward each other). However, in the COM equation, \( \sum \vec{F}_{\text{ext}} = M \vec{a}_{\text{COM}} \), internal forces cancel out in the net force sum. Thus, only external forces (e.g., gravity, friction) affect the COM acceleration. If \( \sum \vec{F}_{\text{ext}} = 0 \), the COM velocity remains constant, regardless of internal motion (e.g., two masses orbiting their COM).
     - **JEE Tip**: Distinguish internal vs. external forces. Common error: Including internal forces in COM acceleration.

38. **Problem 38 (JEE Advanced)**: In a head-on elastic collision, why does a lighter object reverse direction when striking a heavier stationary object?
   - **Solution**: In a 1D elastic collision, momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. For a lighter mass \( m_1 \) at velocity \( v_1 \) colliding with a heavier stationary mass \( m_2 \) (\( m_1 < m_2 \), \( v_2 = 0 \)), the final velocity of \( m_1 \) is approximately \( v_{1f} \approx \frac{m_1 - m_2}{m_1 + m_2} v_1 \). Since \( m_1 < m_2 \), \( m_1 - m_2 < 0 \), so \( v_{1f} \) is negative, indicating reversal. Physically, the heavier mass resists motion, transferring momentum back to the lighter mass, causing it to rebound (e.g., a ping-pong ball hitting a stationary bowling ball).
     - **JEE Tip**: Use the elastic collision formula for intuition. Common error: Assuming both objects move forward.

39. **Problem 39 (JEE Advanced)**: Explain the role of the coefficient of restitution in distinguishing elastic and inelastic collisions, with examples.
   - **Solution**: The coefficient of restitution \( e = \frac{v_{2f} - v_{1f}}{v_{1i} - v_{2i}} \) measures the relative velocity of separation post-collision to approach pre-collision. For elastic collisions, \( e = 1 \), meaning kinetic energy is conserved (e.g., billiard balls colliding smoothly). For perfectly inelastic collisions, \( e = 0 \), as objects stick together (e.g., a bullet embedding in a block). Partially inelastic collisions have \( 0 < e < 1 \), with some energy loss (e.g., a tennis ball bouncing off a racket, \( e \approx 0.7 \)). The value of \( e \) quantifies energy dissipation and collision type.
     - **JEE Tip**: Relate \( e \) to energy loss. Common error: Assuming all collisions are elastic or inelastic.

40. **Problem 40 (JEE Advanced)**: A rocket ejects gas at constant velocity. Discuss how momentum conservation determines the rocket’s acceleration.
   - **Solution**: In a rocket, momentum conservation applies as no external forces act in space. The system (rocket + gas) has constant momentum. If the rocket (mass \( m \)) ejects gas at velocity \( \vec{v}_{\text{gas}} \) relative to the rocket, with mass rate \( \frac{dm}{dt} \), the change in momentum of the gas is \( \frac{dm}{dt} \vec{v}_{\text{gas}} \). By conservation, the rocket’s momentum change is equal and opposite: \( m \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = -\frac{dm}{dt} \vec{v}_{\text{gas}} \). Thus, acceleration \( \vec{a} = \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = -\frac{\vec{v}_{\text{gas}}}{m} \frac{dm}{dt} \). The rocket accelerates opposite to the gas ejection (e.g., upward if gas is ejected downward).
     - **JEE Tip**: Use variable mass systems for rockets. Common error: Ignoring mass decrease.

41. **Problem 41 (JEE Advanced)**: Why does the COM of a non-uniform rod differ from its geometric center? Provide an example.
   - **Solution**: For a non-uniform rod, the mass distribution varies along its length, so the COM, \( \vec{r}_{\text{COM}} = \frac{\int \rho(x) \vec{r} \, dx}{\int \rho(x) \, dx} \), depends on the density \( \rho(x) \). If density is higher at one end, the COM shifts toward that end, unlike a uniform rod where the COM is at the midpoint. Example: A 2 m rod with density \( \rho(x) = x \, \text{kg/m} \) (x from 0 to 2 m) has more mass near \( x = 2 \), so the COM is closer to \( x = 2 \) (e.g., at \( x \approx 1.33 \, \text{m} \)).
     - **JEE Tip**: Consider density variation. Common error: Assuming uniform density.

42. **Problem 42 (JEE Advanced)**: In a perfectly inelastic collision, explain why kinetic energy is lost and where the energy goes.
   - **Solution**: In a perfectly inelastic collision, objects stick together, conserving momentum but not kinetic energy. Initial kinetic energy \( K_i = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_{1i}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_{2i}^2 \). Post-collision, the combined mass \( m_1 + m_2 \) moves at \( v_f = \frac{m_1 v_{1i} + m_2 v_{2i}}{m_1 + m_2} \), with \( K_f = \frac{1}{2} (m_1 + m_2) v_f^2 \). Since \( v_f \) is a weighted average, \( K_f < K_i \) (e.g., two clay balls sticking). The lost energy is converted to heat, sound, or deformation energy.
     - **JEE Tip**: Energy loss is key in inelastic collisions. Common error: Assuming energy conservation.

43. **Problem 43 (JEE Advanced)**: Discuss the conditions under which the COM of a system accelerates, with reference to external forces.
   - **Solution**: The COM acceleration is given by \( \vec{a}_{\text{COM}} = \frac{\sum \vec{F}_{\text{ext}}}{M} \). The COM accelerates if the net external force \( \sum \vec{F}_{\text{ext}} \neq 0 \). External forces (e.g., gravity, friction) cause acceleration (e.g., a falling system accelerates at \( g \)). Internal forces cancel out. If \( \sum \vec{F}_{\text{ext}} = 0 \) (e.g., an isolated system), \( \vec{a}_{\text{COM}} = 0 \), and the COM moves uniformly or remains stationary.
     - **JEE Tip**: Focus on net external force. Common error: Including internal forces.

44. **Problem 44 (JEE Advanced)**: Explain how momentum conservation applies in a system where one object explodes into multiple fragments.
   - **Solution**: In an explosion, no external forces act (e.g., no gravity during the brief event), so momentum is conserved: \( \vec{p}_{\text{initial}} = \sum \vec{p}_{\text{final}} \). Initially, if the object (mass \( M \), velocity \( \vec{v} \)) is at rest (\( \vec{v} = 0 \)), total momentum is zero. Post-explosion, fragments have momenta \( m_i \vec{v}_i \), and \( \sum m_i \vec{v}_i = 0 \). Example: A bomb splits into two equal fragments; they move oppositely with equal momentum magnitudes. The COM remains stationary.
     - **JEE Tip**: Explosion problems use zero initial momentum. Common error: Assuming non-zero final COM velocity.

45. **Problem 45 (JEE Advanced)**: Why is linear momentum a vector quantity, and how does this affect 2D collision problems?
   - **Solution**: Linear momentum \( \vec{p} = m \vec{v} \) is a vector because velocity \( \vec{v} \) has magnitude and direction, and mass \( m \) is scalar. In 2D collisions, momentum conservation applies separately in x- and y-directions: \( \sum p_{xi} = \sum p_{xf} \), \( \sum p_{yi} = \sum p_{yf} \). This requires resolving velocities into components (e.g., \( v_x = v \cos\theta \)). Example: Two balls colliding at an angle need x- and y-momentum equations solved simultaneously, unlike 1D where only one direction applies.
     - **JEE Tip**: Use component analysis in 2D. Common error: Treating 2D collisions as 1D.

46. **Problem 46 (JEE Advanced)**: A system of particles has a moving COM. Discuss how to choose a reference frame to simplify momentum analysis.
   - **Solution**: Choosing the COM frame (where \( \vec{v}_{\text{COM}} = 0 \)) simplifies momentum analysis. In this frame, total momentum is zero: \( \sum m_i \vec{v}_i' = 0 \), where \( \vec{v}_i' \) are velocities relative to the COM. For collisions, relative velocities are easier to analyze (e.g., elastic collisions reduce to approach/separation symmetry). Example: In a 2D collision, the COM frame eliminates net motion, focusing on relative motion. Transform back to the lab frame for final velocities. If external forces act, the lab frame may be needed.
     - **JEE Tip**: COM frame simplifies collision problems. Common error: Using lab frame for complex systems.

47. **Problem 47 (JEE Advanced)**: Explain the significance of the center of mass in analyzing the motion of a rigid body under external forces.
   - **Solution**: The COM is the point where a rigid body’s mass is effectively concentrated, and external forces act as if applied there. The translational motion is governed by \( \sum \vec{F}_{\text{ext}} = M \vec{a}_{\text{COM}} \), allowing complex motion to be split into translation (COM) and rotation (about COM). Example: A thrown wrench follows a parabolic COM path while rotating. This simplifies analysis in problems like projectile motion or collisions, focusing on COM for linear dynamics.
     - **JEE Tip**: Analyze COM for translation. Common error: Applying forces at arbitrary points.

48. **Problem 48 (JEE Advanced)**: In a collision with \( e = 0.8 \), discuss how energy loss affects the post-collision motion compared to an elastic collision.
   - **Solution**: For \( e = 0.8 \), the collision is partially inelastic, conserving momentum but losing kinetic energy. The relative velocity of separation is reduced: \( v_{2f} - v_{1f} = 0.8 (v_{1i} - v_{2i}) \). Kinetic energy loss, \( \Delta K = K_i - K_f \), becomes heat/sound. Compared to elastic (\( e = 1 \), \( K_i = K_f \)), the objects move slower or closer together post-collision (e.g., two carts collide and slow down more than in elastic case). Motion is less “bouncy” but not fully merged (\( e = 0 \)).
     - **JEE Tip**: Use \( e \) to quantify energy loss. Common error: Assuming full energy conservation.

49. **Problem 49 (JEE Advanced)**: Describe how the COM of a system of particles changes if one particle is removed, with an example.
   - **Solution**: The COM is \( \vec{r}_{\text{COM}} = \frac{\sum m_i \vec{r}_i}{M} \). Removing a particle (mass \( m_k \), position \( \vec{r}_k \)) reduces total mass to \( M' = M - m_k \) and adjusts the sum: \( \vec{r}_{\text{COM}}' = \frac{\sum_{i \neq k} m_i \vec{r}_i}{M - m_k} \). The COM shifts away from the removed particle’s position. Example: Two masses, 1 kg at \( (0, 0) \), 1 kg at \( (2, 0) \), COM at \( (1, 0) \). Remove the second mass; new COM = \( (0, 0) \), shifting left.
     - **JEE Tip**: Recalculate COM after removal. Common error: Keeping original total mass.

50. **Problem 50 (JEE Advanced)**: Explain why momentum conservation holds in an inelastic collision but not necessarily in an external force scenario.
   - **Solution**: In an inelastic collision, momentum is conserved because the collision is brief, and external forces (e.g., gravity, friction) produce negligible impulse (\( \int \vec{F}_{\text{ext}} dt \approx 0 \)). Thus, \( \vec{p}_i = \vec{p}_f \). If external forces act significantly (e.g., a block sliding with friction), the net force \( \sum \vec{F}_{\text{ext}} \neq 0 \), so \( \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} = \sum \vec{F}_{\text{ext}} \), and momentum changes (e.g., friction slows the block). Example: Two carts collide (momentum conserved); a cart pushed with friction (momentum decreases).
     - **JEE Tip**: Check for external forces. Common error: Assuming conservation with friction.

### JEE Advanced-Style Derivation Solutions
51. **Problem 51 (JEE Advanced)**: Derive the center of mass position for a system of \( n \) particles in 3D space.
   - **Solution**: For \( n \) particles with masses \( m_i \) at positions \( \vec{r}_i = (x_i, y_i, z_i) \), the COM is the mass-weighted average position. Define \( \vec{r}_{\text{COM}} = (x_{\text{COM}}, y_{\text{COM}}, z_{\text{COM}}) \). Total mass \( M = \sum_{i=1}^n m_i \). By definition, \( \vec{r}_{\text{COM}} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n m_i \vec{r}_i}{M} \). Component-wise: \( x_{\text{COM}} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n m_i x_i}{M} \), \( y_{\text{COM}} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n m_i y_i}{M} \), \( z_{\text{COM}} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n m_i z_i}{M} \). This follows from balancing moments about the COM, ensuring \( \sum m_i (\vec{r}_i - \vec{r}_{\text{COM}}) = 0 \).
     - **JEE Tip**: Derive components separately for clarity. Common error: Omitting total mass denominator.

52. **Problem 52 (JEE Advanced)**: Derive the final velocities for a 1D elastic collision between two masses using momentum and energy conservation.
   - **Solution**: For masses \( m_1 \), \( m_2 \), initial velocities \( v_{1i} \), \( v_{2i} \), final velocities \( v_{1f} \), \( v_{2f} \). Momentum conservation: \( m_1 v_{1i} + m_2 v_{2i} = m_1 v_{1f} + m_2 v_{2f} \) (1). Kinetic energy conservation: \( \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_{1i}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_{2i}^2 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_{1f}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_{2f}^2 \). Simplify: \( m_1 (v_{1i}^2 - v_{1f}^2) = m_2 (v_{2f}^2 - v_{2i}^2) \) (2). Factor: \( m_1 (v_{1i} - v_{1f})(v_{1i} + v_{1f}) = m_2 (v_{2f} - v_{2i})(v_{2f} + v_{2i}) \). Divide by (1): \( v_{1i} + v_{1f} = v_{2f} + v_{2i} \), so \( v_{1i} - v_{2i} = v_{2f} - v_{1f} \) (3). Solve (1) and (3): From (3), \( v_{2f} = v_{1f} + v_{1i} - v_{2i} \). Substitute into (1): \( m_1 v_{1i} + m_2 v_{2i} = m_1 v_{1f} + m_2 (v_{1f} + v_{1i} - v_{2i}) \). Simplify: \( m_1 v_{1i} + m_2 v_{2i} = (m_1 + m_2) v_{1f} + m_2 v_{1i} - m_2 v_{2i} \). Solve for \( v_{1f} \): \( v_{1f} = \frac{(m_1 - m_2) v_{1i} + 2 m_2 v_{2i}}{m_1 + m_2} \). Similarly, \( v_{2f} = \frac{(m_2 - m_1) v_{2i} + 2 m_1 v_{1i}}{m_1 + m_2} \).
     - **JEE Tip**: Memorize final velocity formulas. Common error: Algebraic errors in substitution.

53. **Problem 53 (JEE Advanced)**: Derive the expression for the velocity of the center of mass for a system of particles with given velocities.
   - **Solution**: For \( n \) particles, masses \( m_i \), velocities \( \vec{v}_i \), the COM velocity is the mass-weighted average: \( \vec{v}_{\text{COM}} = \frac{\sum m_i \vec{v}_i}{\sum m_i} \). Total momentum \( \vec{p}_{\text{total}} = \sum m_i \vec{v}_i \). Total mass \( M = \sum m_i \). Since \( \vec{p}_{\text{total}} = M \vec{v}_{\text{COM}} \), divide by \( M \): \( \vec{v}_{\text{COM}} = \frac{\vec{p}_{\text{total}}}{M} = \frac{\sum m_i \vec{v}_i}{M} \). This holds in 3D, with components \( v_{\text{COM}, x} = \frac{\sum m_i v_{i, x}}{M} \), etc.
     - **JEE Tip**: Relate COM velocity to total momentum. Common error: Forgetting vector summation.

54. **Problem 54 (JEE Advanced)**: Derive the kinetic energy loss in a perfectly inelastic collision between two objects.
   - **Solution**: For masses \( m_1 \), \( m_2 \), initial velocities \( v_{1i} \), \( v_{2i} \), final velocity \( v_f = \frac{m_1 v_{1i} + m_2 v_{2i}}{m_1 + m_2} \) (from momentum conservation). Initial kinetic energy \( K_i = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_{1i}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_{2i}^2 \). Final kinetic energy \( K_f = \frac{1}{2} (m_1 + m_2) v_f^2 \). Loss: \( \Delta K = K_i - K_f \). Substitute \( v_f \): \( K_f = \frac{1}{2} (m_1 + m_2) \left( \frac{m_1 v_{1i} + m_2 v_{2i}}{m_1 + m_2} \right)^2 = \frac{(m_1 v_{1i} + m_2 v_{2i})^2}{2 (m_1 + m_2)} \). Simplify \( \Delta K = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_{1i}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_{2i}^2 - \frac{(m_1 v_{1i} + m_2 v_{2i})^2}{2 (m_1 + m_2)} \). Factor: \( \Delta K = \frac{1}{2} \frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} (v_{1i} - v_{2i})^2 \), showing loss depends on relative velocity squared.
     - **JEE Tip**: Energy loss is positive. Common error: Incorrect simplification of \( v_f^2 \).

55. **Problem 55 (JEE Advanced)**: Derive the momentum change for a rocket ejecting mass at constant velocity.
   - **Solution**: Rocket mass \( m \), velocity \( \vec{v} \), ejects mass \( dm \) at velocity \( \vec{v}_{\text{gas}} \) relative to rocket. In time \( dt \), mass ejected = \( \frac{dm}{dt} dt \), with momentum \( \frac{dm}{dt} \vec{v}_{\text{gas}} dt \). Initial system momentum: \( m \vec{v} \). After \( dt \), rocket mass = \( m - dm \), velocity \( \vec{v} + d\vec{v} \), momentum \( (m - dm)(\vec{v} + d\vec{v}) \). Gas momentum: \( dm \vec{v}_{\text{gas}} \). Conservation: \( m \vec{v} = (m - dm)(\vec{v} + d\vec{v}) + dm \vec{v}_{\text{gas}} \). Neglect second-order terms: \( m \vec{v} = m \vec{v} + m d\vec{v} - dm \vec{v} + dm \vec{v}_{\text{gas}} \). Simplify: \( m d\vec{v} = dm (\vec{v}_{\text{gas}} - \vec{v}) \). Since \( \frac{dm}{dt} \) is negative (mass loss), thrust force \( \vec{F} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} = -\frac{dm}{dt} (\vec{v}_{\text{gas}} - \vec{v}) \).
     - **JEE Tip**: Account for mass decrease. Common error: Ignoring relative velocity.

56. **Problem 56 (JEE Advanced)**: Derive the center of mass coordinates for a uniform triangular lamina.
   - **Solution**: For a triangle with vertices at \( (x_1, y_1) \), \( (x_2, y_2) \), \( (x_3, y_3) \), the COM is the centroid, averaging vertex coordinates due to uniform density. \( x_{\text{COM}} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3}{3} \), \( y_{\text{COM}} = \frac{y_1 + y_2 + y_3}{3} \). Proof: Divide triangle into infinitesimal masses \( dm \). Area \( A = \frac{1}{2} |(x_1 (y_2 - y_3) + x_2 (y_3 - y_1) + x_3 (y_1 - y_2))| \). COM via integration: \( x_{\text{COM}} = \frac{1}{A} \iint x \, dA \). Using barycentric coordinates, the centroid emerges as the average of vertices.
     - **JEE Tip**: Use centroid for uniform shapes. Common error: Assuming non-uniform density.

57. **Problem 57 (JEE Advanced)**: Derive the condition for zero momentum change in a system under internal forces only.
   - **Solution**: Momentum change is governed by \( \frac{d\vec{p}_{\text{total}}}{dt} = \sum \vec{F}_{\text{ext}} \). Internal forces (e.g., particle interactions) are equal and opposite (Newton’s third law), so their sum is zero: \( \sum \vec{F}_{\text{int}} = 0 \). If only internal forces act, \( \sum \vec{F}_{\text{ext}} = 0 \), so \( \frac{d\vec{p}_{\text{total}}}{dt} = 0 \), and \( \vec{p}_{\text{total}} \) is constant. Condition: No external forces (e.g., isolated system).
     - **JEE Tip**: Internal forces cancel. Common error: Including internal forces in momentum change.

58. **Problem 58 (JEE Advanced)**: Derive the final velocity formula for a 1D inelastic collision with coefficient of restitution \( e \).
   - **Solution**: For masses \( m_1 \), \( m_2 \), initial velocities \( v_{1i} \), \( v_{2i} \), final velocities \( v_{1f} \), \( v_{2f} \). Momentum conservation: \( m_1 v_{1i} + m_2 v_{2i} = m_1 v_{1f} + m_2 v_{2f} \) (1). Restitution: \( v_{2f} - v_{1f} = e (v_{1i} - v_{2i}) \) (2). Solve: From (2), \( v_{2f} = v_{1f} + e (v_{1i} - v_{2i}) \). Substitute into (1): \( m_1 v_{1i} + m_2 v_{2i} = m_1 v_{1f} + m_2 (v_{1f} + e (v_{1i} - v_{2i})) \). Simplify: \( m_1 v_{1i} + m_2 v_{2i} = (m_1 + m_2) v_{1f} + m_2 e (v_{1i} - v_{2i}) \). Solve for \( v_{1f} \): \( v_{1f} = \frac{m_1 v_{1i} + m_2 v_{2i} - m_2 e (v_{1i} - v_{2i})}{m_1 + m_2} \). Similarly, solve for \( v_{2f} \).
     - **JEE Tip**: Use \( e \) for relative velocity. Common error: Misapplying \( e \).

59. **Problem 59 (JEE Advanced)**: Derive the COM position for a continuous body with linear density variation.
   - **Solution**: For a rod of length \( L \), density \( \rho(x) = a + b x \) (x from 0 to \( L \)), total mass \( M = \int_0^L \rho(x) \, dx = \int_0^L (a + b x) \, dx = [a x + \frac{b x^2}{2}]_0^L = a L + \frac{b L^2}{2} \). COM: \( x_{\text{COM}} = \frac{1}{M} \int_0^L x \rho(x) \, dx = \frac{1}{M} \int_0^L x (a + b x) \, dx = \frac{1}{M} [a \frac{x^2}{2} + b \frac{x^3}{3}]_0^L = \frac{a \frac{L^2}{2} + b \frac{L^3}{3}}{a L + \frac{b L^2}{2}} \). Simplify for specific \( a \), \( b \).
     - **JEE Tip**: Integrate density carefully. Common error: Assuming uniform density.

60. **Problem 60 (JEE Advanced)**: Derive the relationship between impulse and momentum change for a single particle.
   - **Solution**: Impulse \( \vec{J} = \int \vec{F} \, dt \). Newton’s second law: \( \vec{F} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} \). Integrate: \( \int \vec{F} \, dt = \int \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} \, dt = \vec{p}_f - \vec{p}_i \). Thus, \( \vec{J} = \Delta \vec{p} \). Impulse equals momentum change (e.g., a force over time changes a ball’s momentum).
     - **JEE Tip**: Impulse is vector. Common error: Ignoring time integral.

61. **Problem 61 (JEE Advanced)**: Derive the energy conservation condition for a 2D elastic collision.
   - **Solution**: In 2D, for masses \( m_1 \), \( m_2 \), initial velocities \( \vec{v}_{1i} \), \( \vec{v}_{2i} \), final velocities \( \vec{v}_{1f} \), \( \vec{v}_{2f} \). Kinetic energy conservation: \( \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_{1i}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_{2i}^2 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_{1f}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_{2f}^2 \). Momentum conservation: \( m_1 \vec{v}_{1i} + m_2 \vec{v}_{2i} = m_1 \vec{v}_{1f} + m_2 \vec{v}_{2f} \). In components: \( m_1 v_{1i,x} + m_2 v_{2i,x} = m_1 v_{1f,x} + m_2 v_{2f,x} \), \( m_1 v_{1i,y} + m_2 v_{2i,y} = m_1 v_{1f,y} + m_2 v_{2f,y} \). Energy condition: \( v_{1i}^2 = v_{1i,x}^2 + v_{1i,y}^2 \), etc., ensures scalar energy equality post-collision.
     - **JEE Tip**: Combine momentum and energy equations. Common error: Ignoring 2D components.

62. **Problem 62 (JEE Advanced)**: Derive the COM velocity for a system after an explosion with no external forces.
   - **Solution**: Initial momentum \( \vec{p}_i = M \vec{v}_i \). Post-explosion, fragments have momenta \( m_i \vec{v}_i \). Momentum conservation: \( M \vec{v}_i = \sum m_i \vec{v}_i \). COM velocity \( \vec{v}_{\text{COM}} = \frac{\sum m_i \vec{v}_i}{M} = \frac{M \vec{v}_i}{M} = \vec{v}_i \). The COM velocity remains unchanged, as internal explosion forces cancel.
     - **JEE Tip**: COM velocity is constant in isolated systems. Common error: Assuming fragment motion changes COM.

63. **Problem 63 (JEE Advanced)**: Derive the momentum conservation equation for a system with variable mass.
   - **Solution**: For a system (e.g., rocket), mass \( m \), velocity \( \vec{v} \), ejects mass \( dm \) at \( \vec{v}_{\text{gas}} \). Initial momentum: \( m \vec{v} \). After \( dt \), rocket: \( (m - dm)(\vec{v} + d\vec{v}) \), gas: \( dm \vec{v}_{\text{gas}} \). Conservation: \( m \vec{v} = (m - dm)(\vec{v} + d\vec{v}) + dm \vec{v}_{\text{gas}} \). Neglect \( dm d\vec{v} \): \( m \vec{v} = m \vec{v} + m d\vec{v} - dm \vec{v} + dm \vec{v}_{\text{gas}} \). Simplify: \( m d\vec{v} = dm (\vec{v}_{\text{gas}} - \vec{v}) \). Rate: \( \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} = m \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = -\frac{dm}{dt} (\vec{v}_{\text{gas}} - \vec{v}) \).
     - **JEE Tip**: Variable mass requires careful momentum accounting. Common error: Ignoring relative velocity.

64. **Problem 64 (JEE Advanced)**: Derive the final velocities for an oblique elastic collision in 2D using momentum conservation.
   - **Solution**: For masses \( m_1 \), \( m_2 \), initial velocities \( \vec{v}_{1i} \), \( \vec{v}_{2i} \), final velocities \( \vec{v}_{1f} \), \( \vec{v}_{2f} \). Momentum conservation: \( m_1 \vec{v}_{1i} + m_2 \vec{v}_{2i} = m_1 \vec{v}_{1f} + m_2 \vec{v}_{2f} \). In x: \( m_1 v_{1i,x} + m_2 v_{2i,x} = m_1 v_{1f,x} + m_2 v_{2f,x} \). In y: \( m_1 v_{1i,y} + m_2 v_{2i,y} = m_1 v_{1f,y} + m_2 v_{2f,y} \). Energy conservation: \( \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_{1i}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_{2i}^2 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_{1f}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_{2f}^2 \). Solve numerically or use angles and restitution for specific cases (e.g., glancing collisions).
     - **JEE Tip**: Solve components separately. Common error: Mixing x- and y-equations.

65. **Problem 65 (JEE Advanced)**: Derive the center of mass position for a uniform circular disk with a hole removed.
   - **Solution**: Disk mass \( M \), radius \( R \), center at origin. Hole mass \( m \), radius \( r \), center at \( (d, 0) \). Density \( \rho = \frac{M}{\pi R^2} \). Hole mass \( m = \rho \pi r^2 = \frac{M r^2}{R^2} \). Original disk COM at \( (0, 0) \). Treat system as disk minus hole: \( \vec{r}_{\text{COM}} = \frac{M \vec{r}_{\text{disk}} - m \vec{r}_{\text{hole}}}{M - m} \). Disk COM \( \vec{r}_{\text{disk}} = (0, 0) \), hole COM \( \vec{r}_{\text{hole}} = (d, 0) \). \( x_{\text{COM}} = \frac{0 - \frac{M r^2}{R^2} d}{M - \frac{M r^2}{R^2}} = -\frac{r^2 d}{R^2 - r^2} \). \( y_{\text{COM}} = 0 \). COM shifts opposite the hole.
     - **JEE Tip**: Use subtraction method. Common error: Incorrect hole mass calculation.

### NEET-Style Conceptual Solutions
66. **Problem 66 (NEET)**: Explain how the center of mass of a human body shifts during a jump, affecting balance.
   - **Solution**: The human body’s COM is near the torso when standing. During a jump, as arms and legs move upward, the COM shifts upward slightly due to mass redistribution (e.g., raising arms increases \( y_{\text{COM}} \)). To maintain balance, the jumper adjusts posture to keep the COM over the feet before takeoff. Mid-air, the COM follows a parabolic path, and limb movements (e.g., tucking legs) don’t change the COM trajectory but affect body orientation around it, aiding landing stability.
     - **NEET Tip**: Relate COM to balance in motion. Common error: Assuming COM is fixed.

67. **Problem 67 (NEET)**: Discuss why a car’s momentum changes when it brakes, and how this relates to external forces.
   - **Solution**: A car’s momentum \( \vec{p} = m \vec{v} \) changes when braking due to the external frictional force between tires and road, which opposes motion. By Newton’s second law, \( \sum \vec{F}_{\text{ext}} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} \). The braking force reduces velocity, thus decreasing momentum magnitude (e.g., from 1000 kg·m/s to 0). Without external forces (e.g., in space), momentum would remain constant.
     - **NEET Tip**: Identify external forces in real-world scenarios. Common error: Assuming internal forces change momentum.

68. **Problem 68 (NEET)**: In a collision between two balls, explain why momentum is conserved but kinetic energy may not be.
   - **Solution**: Momentum is conserved in collisions because the collision is brief, and external forces (e.g., gravity) produce negligible impulse (\( \sum \vec{F}_{\text{ext}} \approx 0 \)), so \( \vec{p}_i = \vec{p}_f \). Kinetic energy is conserved only in elastic collisions (e.g., hard billiard balls). In inelastic collisions (e.g., soft clay balls), energy is lost to heat, sound, or deformation, reducing \( K_f < K_i \), while momentum remains unchanged due to Newton’s third law governing internal forces.
     - **NEET Tip**: Distinguish collision types. Common error: Assuming all collisions conserve energy.

69. **Problem 69 (NEET)**: Describe how the COM of a bicycle and rider affects stability during a turn.
   - **Solution**: The COM of the bicycle-rider system is near the rider’s torso, above the wheels. During a turn, stability requires the COM to remain over the support base (tires’ contact points). The rider leans inward, shifting the COM toward the turn’s center, aligning it with the centripetal force provided by friction. If the COM shifts too far outward (e.g., not leaning enough), the bike tips over due to unbalanced torque.
     - **NEET Tip**: Relate COM to stability in dynamics. Common error: Ignoring leaning effect.

70. **Problem 70 (NEET)**: Explain the role of momentum conservation in a person pushing off a wall while skating.
   - **Solution**: When a skater pushes off a wall, the system (skater + wall) conserves momentum because external forces (e.g., friction, gravity) produce negligible impulse during the brief push. Initially, the skater is at rest, so the system’s momentum is zero. The skater exerts a force on the wall, and the wall exerts an equal and opposite force on the skater (Newton’s third law), accelerating the skater backward. Momentum conservation: \( m_{\text{skater}} \vec{v}_{\text{skater}} + m_{\text{wall}} \vec{v}_{\text{wall}} = 0 \). The wall’s large mass ensures \( \vec{v}_{\text{wall}} \approx 0 \), so the skater gains velocity (e.g., a 60 kg skater pushing with 120 N for 0.5 s gains \( v \approx 1 \, \text{m/s} \)). This principle explains the skater’s motion.
     - **NEET Tip**: Focus on the system’s initial and final states. Common error: Assuming the wall’s motion is significant.

71. **Problem 71 (NEET)**: Discuss why a bullet embedding in a block is an inelastic collision, with energy implications.
   - **Solution**: A bullet embedding in a block is a perfectly inelastic collision because the objects stick together post-collision, conserving momentum but not kinetic energy. Momentum conservation holds as the collision is brief, and external forces (e.g., gravity) produce minimal impulse. Initial kinetic energy (\( K_i = \frac{1}{2} m_{\text{bullet}} v_{\text{bullet}}^2 \)) is higher than final kinetic energy (\( K_f = \frac{1}{2} (m_{\text{bullet}} + m_{\text{block}}) v_f^2 \)), where \( v_f = \frac{m_{\text{bullet}} v_{\text{bullet}}}{m_{\text{bullet}} + m_{\text{block}}} \). The energy loss (\( K_i - K_f \)) is converted to heat, sound, and deformation (e.g., a 0.01 kg bullet at 500 m/s embeds in a 1 kg block, losing ~1249 J of kinetic energy). This distinguishes it from elastic collisions where energy is conserved.
     - **NEET Tip**: Identify collision type by post-collision behavior. Common error: Assuming energy conservation in inelastic collisions.

72. **Problem 72 (NEET)**: Explain how the COM of a boat and passenger changes when the passenger moves to one end.
   - **Solution**: The center of mass (COM) of the boat-passenger system is initially balanced, depending on their masses and positions. If the passenger moves to one end, the system’s COM shifts toward that end because the passenger’s mass contributes more to the weighted average position (\( \vec{r}_{\text{COM}} = \frac{m_{\text{passenger}} \vec{r}_{\text{passenger}} + m_{\text{boat}} \vec{r}_{\text{boat}}}{m_{\text{passenger}} + m_{\text{boat}}} \)). Without external forces (e.g., assuming calm water), the COM remains fixed relative to the water. As the passenger moves forward, the boat moves backward to keep the COM stationary (e.g., a 60 kg passenger moving 2 m forward in a 240 kg boat shifts the COM, causing the boat to move ~0.4 m backward). This maintains system balance.
     - **NEET Tip**: Use conservation of COM position in isolated systems. Common error: Ignoring boat’s counter-motion.

73. **Problem 73 (NEET)**: In a head-on collision, describe why a heavier vehicle experiences less velocity change.
   - **Solution**: In a head-on collision, momentum conservation applies: \( m_1 \vec{v}_{1i} + m_2 \vec{v}_{2i} = m_1 \vec{v}_{1f} + m_2 \vec{v}_{2f} \). For a heavier vehicle (\( m_1 > m_2 \)), the velocity change \( \Delta \vec{v}_1 = \vec{v}_{1f} - \vec{v}_{1i} \) is smaller because the heavier mass resists acceleration more (Newton’s second law, \( \vec{a} = \frac{\vec{F}}{m} \)). Example: A 2000 kg truck at 10 m/s collides with a 1000 kg car at -10 m/s. The truck’s velocity change is smaller (e.g., ~3.33 m/s vs. ~6.67 m/s for the car in inelastic collision). The heavier vehicle’s larger inertia reduces its response to the collision force.
     - **NEET Tip**: Relate mass to velocity change. Common error: Assuming equal velocity changes.

74. **Problem 74 (NEET)**: Discuss the practical significance of momentum conservation in a car crash scenario.
   - **Solution**: Momentum conservation in a car crash helps predict post-collision motion and assess safety. For two cars colliding, total momentum before equals after (\( m_1 \vec{v}_{1i} + m_2 \vec{v}_{2i} = m_1 \vec{v}_{1f} + m_2 \vec{v}_{2f} \)), assuming minimal external forces (e.g., friction) during the brief impact. This allows engineers to calculate final velocities, informing airbag deployment and crumple zone design to absorb energy. Example: A 1500 kg car at 20 m/s hitting a stationary 1000 kg car results in a combined velocity (inelastic) of ~12 m/s, guiding safety measures to reduce injury.
     - **NEET Tip**: Apply conservation to real-world impacts. Common error: Ignoring external forces like friction.

75. **Problem 75 (NEET)**: Explain why the COM of a uniform ladder remains at its midpoint regardless of orientation.
   - **Solution**: For a uniform ladder, mass is evenly distributed along its length, so the COM is at the geometric midpoint (e.g., at \( L/2 \) for length \( L \)). This holds regardless of orientation (vertical, horizontal, or angled) because the mass distribution is symmetric about the midpoint, and \( \vec{r}_{\text{COM}} = \frac{\int_0^L x \rho \, dx}{\int_0^L \rho \, dx} = \frac{L/2 \cdot \rho L}{\rho L} = \frac{L}{2} \). Example: A 4 m ladder’s COM is at 2 m along its length, whether upright or lying flat, simplifying balance calculations in mechanics problems.
     - **NEET Tip**: Symmetry determines COM for uniform objects. Common error: Assuming COM shifts with orientation.

76. **Problem 76 (NEET)**: Describe how momentum conservation applies when a swimmer dives off a diving board.
   - **Solution**: The swimmer-diving board system conserves momentum during the dive if external forces (e.g., air resistance) are negligible. Initially, both are at rest (momentum = 0). As the swimmer pushes down on the board, the board exerts an upward force (Newton’s third law), propelling the swimmer upward. Momentum conservation: \( m_{\text{swimmer}} \vec{v}_{\text{swimmer}} + m_{\text{board}} \vec{v}_{\text{board}} = 0 \). The board’s large mass or anchoring means \( \vec{v}_{\text{board}} \approx 0 \), so the swimmer gains significant velocity (e.g., a 70 kg swimmer gains ~2 m/s upward). The system’s COM remains nearly stationary.
     - **NEET Tip**: Consider the entire system’s momentum. Common error: Focusing only on the swimmer.

77. **Problem 77 (NEET)**: Explain the difference between elastic and inelastic collisions in the context of a ball bouncing off a wall.
   - **Solution**: When a ball bounces off a massive wall, an elastic collision (\( e = 1 \)) means the ball reverses velocity with no kinetic energy loss (e.g., a superball rebounds at nearly the same speed, \( v_f \approx -v_i \)). An inelastic collision (\( 0 \leq e < 1 \)) involves energy loss to heat or deformation, reducing the rebound speed (e.g., a tennis ball with \( e \approx 0.7 \) rebounds at \( v_f \approx -0.7 v_i \)). Momentum is conserved in both cases, as the wall’s large mass ensures minimal velocity change, but kinetic energy is only conserved in the elastic case.
     - **NEET Tip**: Use \( e \) to differentiate collisions. Common error: Assuming all bounces are elastic.

78. **Problem 78 (NEET)**: Discuss how the COM of a human body aids in maintaining posture during walking.
   - **Solution**: The human body’s COM, located near the pelvis, must remain over the base of support (feet) to maintain posture while walking. During each step, the COM shifts slightly as weight transfers from one foot to another, but muscles adjust to keep it aligned (e.g., swinging arms or leaning slightly). If the COM moves outside the base (e.g., slipping), balance is lost unless corrected (e.g., stepping forward). This dynamic COM adjustment ensures stability, as seen in a steady gait.
     - **NEET Tip**: Relate COM to stability in motion. Common error: Ignoring dynamic COM shifts.

79. **Problem 79 (NEET)**: Explain why momentum conservation is critical in analyzing a rocket’s motion in space.
   - **Solution**: In space, a rocket operates in an isolated system with no external forces (e.g., no air resistance). Momentum conservation dictates that the total momentum of the rocket and ejected gas remains constant. As the rocket ejects gas backward at high velocity, the gas gains momentum backward, and the rocket gains equal and opposite momentum forward (\( m_{\text{rocket}} \vec{v}_{\text{rocket}} + m_{\text{gas}} \vec{v}_{\text{gas}} = 0 \)). This thrust propels the rocket (e.g., a 1000 kg rocket ejecting 1 kg/s at 2000 m/s gains ~2 m/s² acceleration). Conservation analysis predicts velocity changes critical for navigation.
     - **NEET Tip**: Apply conservation to variable mass systems. Common error: Ignoring gas momentum.

80. **Problem 80 (NEET)**: Describe the effect of an external force on the momentum of a system, using a falling object as an example.
   - **Solution**: An external force changes a system’s momentum via \( \sum \vec{F}_{\text{ext}} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} \). For a falling object (e.g., a 1 kg ball), the external force is gravity (\( \vec{F}_g = m \vec{g} = 9.8 \, \text{N} \) downward). Initially at rest (\( \vec{p}_i = 0 \)), the ball’s momentum increases as it falls (\( \vec{p} = m \vec{v} \)), with \( \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} = m \vec{g} \). After 2 s, velocity \( \vec{v} = -9.8 \times 2 = -19.6 \, \text{m/s} \), momentum \( \vec{p} = 1 \times -19.6 = -19.6 \, \text{kg·m/s} \). Without gravity (external force), momentum would remain zero.
     - **NEET Tip**: Identify external forces driving momentum change. Common error: Assuming conservation during free fall.

81. **Problem 81 (NEET)**: Explain how the COM of a seesaw with two people balances when their masses differ.
   - **Solution**: The COM of a seesaw with two people (masses \( m_1 \), \( m_2 \)) is \( \vec{r}_{\text{COM}} = \frac{m_1 \vec{r}_1 + m_2 \vec{r}_2}{m_1 + m_2} \). For balance, the COM must align with the pivot (fulcrum). If masses differ (e.g., \( m_1 = 60 \, \text{kg} \), \( m_2 = 30 \, \text{kg} \)), the heavier person sits closer to the pivot to reduce their moment arm (\( r_1 < r_2 \)). Example: On a 4 m seesaw, if \( m_1 \) is at 1 m from the pivot, \( m_2 \) must be at 2 m (\( m_1 r_1 = m_2 r_2 \)) to balance the COM at the pivot, ensuring no rotation.
     - **NEET Tip**: Balance requires COM at pivot. Common error: Assuming equal distances for unequal masses.

82. **Problem 82 (NEET)**: Discuss why kinetic energy loss in an inelastic collision affects the motion of objects post-collision.
   - **Solution**: In an inelastic collision, momentum is conserved, but kinetic energy is lost to heat, sound, or deformation. This reduces the post-collision kinetic energy (\( K_f < K_i \)), resulting in slower relative motion or objects sticking together (perfectly inelastic, \( e = 0 \)). Example: Two 1 kg carts at 5 m/s and -5 m/s collide inelastically (\( e = 0 \)); initial \( K_i = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 5^2 + \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 5^2 = 25 \, \text{J} \), final \( v_f = 0 \), \( K_f = 0 \). The loss (25 J) means no motion post-collision, unlike an elastic collision where objects rebound.
     - **NEET Tip**: Energy loss reduces motion intensity. Common error: Expecting elastic behavior.

83. **Problem 83 (NEET)**: Explain the role of momentum in a gymnast’s vault, focusing on takeoff and landing.
   - **Solution**: During a gymnast’s vault, momentum conservation governs the takeoff and landing phases. At takeoff, the gymnast pushes against the vault table, gaining upward and forward momentum via the table’s reaction force (Newton’s third law). The system (gymnast + table) conserves momentum, but the table’s large mass minimizes its motion, so the gymnast’s momentum increases significantly (e.g., a 50 kg gymnast gains ~3 m/s forward). In the air, momentum is conserved horizontally (no horizontal forces), but gravity changes vertical momentum. At landing, the gymnast’s momentum is absorbed by ground reaction forces, requiring balance to avoid falling.
     - **NEET Tip**: Analyze phases separately. Common error: Ignoring external forces like gravity.

84. **Problem 84 (NEET)**: Describe how the COM of a loaded truck affects its stability on a slope.
   - **Solution**: A loaded truck’s COM is higher and shifted depending on the load’s placement (e.g., heavy cargo raises COM). On a slope, stability requires the COM to remain over the base of support (wheels). If the COM is high or shifts toward the downhill side (e.g., uneven load), the truck risks tipping if the COM moves outside the wheelbase. Example: A truck with COM 1.5 m above ground on a 20° slope needs the COM projected within the ~2 m wheelbase width to avoid overturning, requiring careful load distribution.
     - **NEET Tip**: COM position determines tipping risk. Common error: Ignoring slope angle effects.

85. **Problem 85 (NEET)**: Explain why a ball dropped from a height conserves momentum until it hits the ground.
   - **Solution**: A dropped ball conserves momentum in the horizontal direction during free fall because no horizontal external forces act (e.g., air resistance is often negligible). Vertically, momentum changes due to gravity (\( \vec{F}_g = m \vec{g} \)), so \( \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} = m \vec{g} \). Example: A 0.5 kg ball dropped from 10 m has initial \( \vec{p} = 0 \). After 1 s, \( v = -9.8 \, \text{m/s} \), \( \vec{p} = 0.5 \times -9.8 = -4.9 \, \text{kg·m/s} \). Momentum is not conserved vertically until impact, when the ground exerts a force, stopping the ball.
     - **NEET Tip**: Distinguish directional conservation. Common error: Assuming total momentum conservation in free fall.

86. **Problem 86 (NEET)**: Discuss the practical application of momentum conservation in a billiards game.
   - **Solution**: In billiards, collisions between balls are nearly elastic, conserving momentum and nearly conserving kinetic energy. When the cue ball strikes a stationary ball, momentum conservation (\( m_{\text{cue}} \vec{v}_{\text{cue,i}} = m_{\text{cue}} \vec{v}_{\text{cue,f}} + m_{\text{ball}} \vec{v}_{\text{ball,f}} \)) predicts final velocities. Example: A 0.17 kg cue ball at 2 m/s hits a stationary 0.17 kg ball; post-collision, the cue ball stops, and the target ball moves at ~2 m/s (1D elastic). This helps players predict ball paths, adjusting angles and speeds for precise shots.
     - **NEET Tip**: Apply conservation to predict motion. Common error: Ignoring angle effects in 2D collisions.

87. **Problem 87 (NEET)**: Explain how the COM of a double-star system influences orbital motion.
   - **Solution**: In a double-star system, the COM is the point where the stars orbit, determined by their masses and positions (\( \vec{r}_{\text{COM}} = \frac{m_1 \vec{r}_1 + m_2 \vec{r}_2}{m_1 + m_2} \)). If masses are equal, the COM is midway; if unequal, it’s closer to the heavier star. The stars orbit the COM due to mutual gravitational forces, which cancel in the COM frame, keeping it stationary (no external forces). Example: A 2 solar mass star and a 1 solar mass star orbit their COM, with the heavier star closer, affecting orbital radii and periods.
     - **NEET Tip**: COM is the orbital pivot. Common error: Assuming stars orbit a fixed point.

88. **Problem 88 (NEET)**: Describe why a person recoils when firing a gun, using momentum conservation.
   - **Solution**: When firing a gun, the system (person + gun + bullet) conserves momentum. Initially, momentum is zero (at rest). The bullet is propelled forward with momentum \( m_{\text{bullet}} \vec{v}_{\text{bullet}} \). By conservation, the person and gun recoil backward: \( (m_{\text{person}} + m_{\text{gun}}) \vec{v}_{\text{recoil}} = -m_{\text{bullet}} \vec{v}_{\text{bullet}} \). Example: A 0.01 kg bullet at 400 m/s causes a 70 kg person + 1 kg gun to recoil at \( v_{\text{recoil}} \approx -0.056 \, \text{m/s} \). The recoil velocity is small due to the large mass difference.
     - **NEET Tip**: Momentum is conserved in recoil. Common error: Ignoring person’s mass.

89. **Problem 89 (NEET)**: Explain the effect of friction on momentum conservation in a sliding block scenario.
   - **Solution**: Friction is an external force that prevents momentum conservation in a sliding block. Initially, a block sliding on a rough surface has momentum \( \vec{p}_i = m \vec{v}_i \). Friction (\( \vec{F}_{\text{friction}} = -\mu_k m \vec{g} \)) opposes motion, reducing velocity over time (\( \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} = \vec{F}_{\text{friction}} \)). Example: A 2 kg block at 5 m/s with \( \mu_k = 0.3 \) experiences \( F_{\text{friction}} = 0.3 \times 2 \times 9.8 = 5.88 \, \text{N} \), slowing it and changing momentum until it stops. Without friction, momentum would be conserved.
     - **NEET Tip**: External forces disrupt conservation. Common error: Assuming conservation with friction.

90. **Problem 90 (NEET)**: Discuss how momentum conservation applies when a person jumps off a moving cart.
   - **Solution**: The person-cart system conserves momentum if external forces (e.g., friction) are negligible. Initially, the system moves with momentum \( (m_{\text{person}} + m_{\text{cart}}) \vec{v}_{\text{initial}} \). When the person jumps off with velocity \( \vec{v}_{\text{person}} \) relative to the ground, the cart adjusts its velocity \( \vec{v}_{\text{cart}} \). Conservation: \( (m_{\text{person}} + m_{\text{cart}}) \vec{v}_{\text{initial}} = m_{\text{person}} \vec{v}_{\text{person}} + m_{\text{cart}} \vec{v}_{\text{cart}} \). Example: A 60 kg person jumps backward at 2 m/s from a 40 kg cart moving at 3 m/s forward; the cart speeds up to ~4.2 m/s to conserve momentum.
     - **NEET Tip**: Analyze system momentum before and after. Common error: Ignoring cart’s velocity change.

### NEET-Style Numerical Solutions
91. **Problem 91 (NEET)**: A 0.3 kg ball at 12 m/s east collides with a 0.5 kg ball at rest, moving together. Calculate the final velocity.
   - **Solution**: Initial momentum: \( \vec{p}_i = (0.3 \times 12) + (0.5 \times 0) = 3.6 \, \text{kg·m/s} \) east. Total mass = \( 0.3 + 0.5 = 0.8 \, \text{kg} \). By conservation, \( 3.6 = 0.8 v_f \), \( v_f = \frac{3.6}{0.8} = 4.5 \, \text{m/s} \) east (2 significant figures).
     - **Answer**: (a) 4.5 m/s
     - **NEET Tip**: Sum masses for inelastic collisions. Common error: Forgetting the stationary ball’s contribution.

92. **Problem 92 (NEET)**: A 4 kg cart at 3 m/s north collides with a 2 kg cart at 1 m/s south, sticking together. Calculate the final speed.
   - **Solution**: Initial momentum: \( \vec{p}_i = (4 \times 3) + (2 \times -1) = 12 - 2 = 10 \, \text{kg·m/s} \) north. Total mass = \( 4 + 2 = 6 \, \text{kg} \). \( 10 = 6 v_f \), \( v_f = \frac{10}{6} \approx 1.67 \, \text{m/s} \) north (3 significant figures).
     - **Answer**: (b) 1.67 m/s
     - **NEET Tip**: Speed is magnitude; verify direction. Common error: Incorrect velocity signs.

93. **Problem 93 (NEET)**: A 0.15 kg bullet at 200 m/s embeds in a 1.85 kg block at rest. Calculate the final velocity.
   - **Solution**: Initial momentum: \( \vec{p}_i = (0.15 \times 200) + (1.85 \times 0) = 30 \, \text{kg·m/s} \). Total mass = \( 0.15 + 1.85 = 2.0 \, \text{kg} \). \( 30 = 2.0 v_f \), \( v_f = \frac{30}{2.0} = 15 \, \text{m/s} \) (2 significant figures).
     - **Answer**: (c) 15 m/s
     - **NEET Tip**: Use total mass post-collision. Common error: Ignoring block’s mass.

94. **Problem 94 (NEET)**: Two masses, 2 kg at \( (0, 1) \, \text{m} \), 3 kg at \( (2, 0) \, \text{m} \). Calculate the COM y-coordinate.
   - **Solution**: Total mass \( M = 2 + 3 = 5 \, \text{kg} \). \( y_{\text{COM}} = \frac{(2 \times 1) + (3 \times 0)}{5} = \frac{2 + 0}{5} = \frac{2}{5} = 0.4 \, \text{m} \) (2 significant figures).
     - **Answer**: (a) 0.4 m
     - **NEET Tip**: Use only y-coordinates. Common error: Mixing x and y terms.

95. **Problem 95 (NEET)**: A 0.6 kg object at 5 m/s west collides with a 0.4 kg object at 2 m/s east, moving together. Calculate the final velocity.
   - **Solution**: Initial momentum: \( \vec{p}_i = (0.6 \times -5) + (0.4 \times 2) = -3 + 0.8 = -2.2 \, \text{kg·m/s} \) west. Total mass = \( 0.6 + 0.4 = 1.0 \, \text{kg} \). \( -2.2 = 1.0 v_f \), \( v_f = -2.2 \, \text{m/s} \) (2.2 m/s west, 2 significant figures).
     - **Answer**: (b) 2.2 m/s west
     - **NEET Tip**: Negative velocity indicates west. Common error: Direction confusion.

### NEET-Style Derivation Solutions
96. **Problem 96 (NEET)**: Derive the final velocity for a perfectly inelastic collision in one dimension.
   - **Solution**: For masses \( m_1 \), \( m_2 \), initial velocities \( v_{1i} \), \( v_{2i} \), final velocity \( v_f \) (objects stick together). Momentum conservation: \( m_1 v_{1i} + m_2 v_{2i} = (m_1 + m_2) v_f \). Solve: \( v_f = \frac{m_1 v_{1i} + m_2 v_{2i}}{m_1 + m_2} \). This reflects the combined mass moving at a weighted average velocity, conserving momentum but not kinetic energy.
     - **NEET Tip**: Combine masses for final velocity. Common error: Assuming separate velocities post-collision.

97. **Problem 97 (NEET)**: Derive the center of mass position for a system of two particles.
   - **Solution**: For two particles, masses \( m_1 \), \( m_2 \), positions \( \vec{r}_1 \), \( \vec{r}_2 \), the COM is the mass-weighted average: \( \vec{r}_{\text{COM}} = \frac{m_1 \vec{r}_1 + m_2 \vec{r}_2}{m_1 + m_2} \). Component-wise: \( x_{\text{COM}} = \frac{m_1 x_1 + m_2 x_2}{m_1 + m_2} \), \( y_{\text{COM}} = \frac{m_1 y_1 + m_2 y_2}{m_1 + m_2} \). This follows from balancing moments, ensuring the COM is the point where external forces act effectively.
     - **NEET Tip**: Simple weighted average for two particles. Common error: Forgetting total mass denominator.

98. **Problem 98 (NEET)**: Derive the momentum conservation equation for a system with no external forces.
   - **Solution**: For a system of particles, Newton’s second law: \( \sum \vec{F}_{\text{ext}} = \frac{d\vec{p}_{\text{total}}}{dt} \), where \( \vec{p}_{\text{total}} = \sum m_i \vec{v}_i \). If no external forces act (\( \sum \vec{F}_{\text{ext}} = 0 \)), then \( \frac{d\vec{p}_{\text{total}}}{dt} = 0 \), so \( \vec{p}_{\text{total}} = \text{constant} \). Thus, initial momentum equals final momentum: \( \sum m_i \vec{v}_{i,\text{initial}} = \sum m_i \vec{v}_{i,\text{final}} \).
     - **NEET Tip**: External forces determine conservation. Common error: Including internal forces.

99. **Problem 99 (NEET)**: Derive the kinetic energy change in an inelastic collision with \( e = 0.5 \).
   - **Solution**: For masses \( m_1 \), \( m_2 \), initial velocities \( v_{1i} \), \( v_{2i} \), final velocities \( v_{1f} \), \( v_{2f} \), \( e = 0.5 \). Momentum: \( m_1 v_{1i} + m_2 v_{2i} = m_1 v_{1f} + m_2 v_{2f} \). Restitution: \( v_{2f} - v_{1f} = 0.5 (v_{1i} - v_{2i}) \). Initial kinetic energy: \( K_i = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_{1i}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_{2i}^2 \). Final: \( K_f = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_{1f}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_{2f}^2 \). Solve for \( v_{1f} \), \( v_{2f} \), then compute \( \Delta K = K_i - K_f \). General form: \( \Delta K = \frac{1}{2} \frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} (1 - e^2) (v_{1i} - v_{2i})^2 \). For \( e = 0.5 \), \( 1 - e^2 = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 \), so \( \Delta K = \frac{3}{8} \frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} (v_{1i} - v_{2i})^2 \).
     - **NEET Tip**: Energy loss depends on \( e \). Common error: Incorrect \( e^2 \) term.

100. **Problem 100 (NEET)**: Derive the COM coordinates for a uniform rectangular plate.
    - **Solution**: For a uniform rectangular plate with length \( a \), width \( b \), mass \( M \), centered at origin (\( x \) from \( -a/2 \) to \( a/2 \), \( y \) from \( -b/2 \) to \( b/2 \)), density \( \rho = \frac{M}{a b} \). COM: \( x_{\text{COM}} = \frac{1}{M} \int_{-a/2}^{a/2} \int_{-b/2}^{b/2} x \rho \, dy \, dx = \frac{\rho}{M} \int_{-a/2}^{a/2} x \left[ y \right]_{-b/2}^{b/2} dx = \frac{\rho b}{M} \int_{-a/2}^{a/2} x \, dx = 0 \) (symmetric). Similarly, \( y_{\text{COM}} = 0 \). COM = \( (0, 0) \) at the center due to symmetry.
      - **NEET Tip**: Symmetry simplifies integration. Common error: Assuming non-zero COM for symmetric shapes.
