# Chapter 43: Energy from the Nucleus

Nuclear energy, derived from the nucleus through fission and fusion, powers reactors and stars, offering immense energy potential with significant challenges. This chapter explores nuclear fission and energy release, nuclear fusion and stellar energy, nuclear reactors and safety, and applications and challenges of nuclear energy. These concepts are critical for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET, appearing in problems on reaction energy, Q-values, and reactor efficiency. With clear explanations, exam-focused examples, and robust problem-solving strategies, this chapter equips students to master nuclear energy in competitive exams, ensuring precision and conceptual clarity.

## 43.1 Nuclear Fission and Energy Release

**Nuclear fission** involves a heavy nucleus (e.g., \( ^{235}_{92}\text{U} \)) splitting into lighter nuclei, releasing energy due to the mass defect. The energy release is calculated as \( Q = \Delta m c^2 \), where \( \Delta m \) is the difference between reactant and product masses. Fission produces neutrons, enabling chain reactions. JEE/NEET problems involve calculating \( Q \)-values or neutron yields. *Fundamentals of Physics* emphasizes fission’s role in energy production.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves calculating the energy released in the fission of \( ^{235}_{92}\text{U} \) to \( ^{141}_{56}\text{Ba} \), \( ^{92}_{36}\text{Kr} \), and 3 neutrons (\( m(^{235}\text{U}) = 235.043930 \, \text{u} \), \( m(^{141}\text{Ba}) = 140.914411 \, \text{u} \), \( m(^{92}\text{Kr}) = 91.926156 \, \text{u} \), \( m_n = 1.008665 \, \text{u} \), 1 u = 931.494 MeV/c²).
- **Solution**: Reaction: \( ^{235}_{92}\text{U} \rightarrow ^{141}_{56}\text{Ba} + ^{92}_{36}\text{Kr} + 3n \). Mass defect: \( \Delta m = m(^{235}\text{U}) - [m(^{141}\text{Ba}) + m(^{92}\text{Kr}) + 3 m_n] \). Compute: \( 3 m_n = 3 \times 1.008665 = 3.025995 \, \text{u} \), products: \( 140.914411 + 91.926156 + 3.025995 = 235.866562 \, \text{u} \). \( \Delta m = 235.043930 - 235.866562 = -0.822632 \, \text{u} \). Energy: \( Q = |\Delta m| \times 931.494 \approx 0.822632 \times 931.494 \approx 766.36 \, \text{MeV} \approx 766 \, \text{MeV} \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025). This is a standard JEE fission problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Sum product masses; subtract reactant mass. Common error: Omitting neutrons.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks the source of fission energy.
- **Solution**: Fission energy comes from the **mass defect**, converted to energy via \( E = \Delta m c^2 \). Option (a) “Mass defect” is correct. This is a typical NEET fission problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Fission splits heavy nuclei; energy from binding difference. Common error: Confusing with fusion.

## 43.2 Nuclear Fusion and Stellar Energy

**Nuclear fusion** combines light nuclei (e.g., \( ^2_1\text{H} + ^3_1\text{H} \rightarrow ^4_2\text{He} + n \)) to form heavier ones, releasing energy due to increased binding energy per nucleon. Fusion powers stars like the Sun. The energy release is calculated as \( Q = \Delta m c^2 \). JEE/NEET problems involve calculating fusion energy or identifying stellar reactions. *University Physics* connects fusion to astrophysics.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves calculating the energy released in the fusion reaction \( ^2_1\text{H} + ^3_1\text{H} \rightarrow ^4_2\text{He} + n \) (\( m(^2\text{H}) = 2.014102 \, \text{u} \), \( m(^3\text{H}) = 3.016049 \, \text{u} \), \( m(^4\text{He}) = 4.002602 \, \text{u} \), \( m_n = 1.008665 \, \text{u} \), 1 u = 931.494 MeV/c²).
- **Solution**: Mass defect: \( \Delta m = [m(^2\text{H}) + m(^3\text{H})] - [m(^4\text{He}) + m_n] \). Compute: reactants: \( 2.014102 + 3.016049 = 5.030151 \, \text{u} \), products: \( 4.002602 + 1.008665 = 5.011267 \, \text{u} \). \( \Delta m = 5.030151 - 5.011267 = 0.018884 \, \text{u} \). Energy: \( Q = 0.018884 \times 931.494 \approx 17.59 \, \text{MeV} \approx 17.6 \, \text{MeV} \). This is a classic JEE fusion problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Ensure mass balance; convert to MeV. Common error: Incorrect product masses.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks what powers the Sun.
- **Solution**: The Sun is powered by **nuclear fusion**, combining hydrogen nuclei to form helium. Option (a) “Nuclear fusion” is correct. This is a typical NEET fusion problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Fusion occurs in stars; distinguish from fission. Common error: Assuming chemical energy.

## 43.3 Nuclear Reactors and Safety

**Nuclear reactors** use controlled fission (e.g., \( ^{235}\text{U} \)) to produce energy, moderated by materials like graphite or water to sustain chain reactions. Safety concerns include radiation leaks, meltdowns, and waste disposal. JEE/NEET problems involve reactor components or efficiency calculations. *Fundamentals of Physics* emphasizes controlled chain reactions.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves a reactor producing 200 MW from \( ^{235}\text{U} \) fission, each releasing 200 MeV. Calculate the mass of \( ^{235}\text{U} \) consumed per day (1 eV = 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ J).
- **Solution**: Energy per fission: \( 200 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV} = 200 \times 10^6 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \approx 3.204 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{J} \). Power: \( 200 \, \text{MW} = 200 \times 10^6 \, \text{J/s} \). Fissions per second: \( \frac{200 \times 10^6}{3.204 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 6.242 \times 10^{18} \). Per day (86400 s): \( 6.242 \times 10^{18} \times 86400 \approx 5.393 \times 10^{23} \). Mass of one \( ^{235}\text{U} \): \( 235 \, \text{u} \approx 235 \times 1.66054 \times 10^{-27} \approx 3.902 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg} \). Total mass: \( 5.393 \times 10^{23} \times 3.902 \times 10^{-25} \approx 0.02104 \, \text{kg} \approx 21.0 \, \text{g} \). This is a standard JEE reactor problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Convert energy to joules; calculate fissions. Common error: Incorrect time conversion.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks the role of moderators in reactors.
- **Solution**: Moderators **slow neutrons** to sustain chain reactions. Option (a) “Slow neutrons” is correct. This is a typical NEET reactor problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Moderators enhance fission; distinguish from control rods. Common error: Confusing with absorbers.

## 43.4 Applications and Challenges of Nuclear Energy

**Applications** include nuclear power plants, medical isotopes, and fusion research. **Challenges** include radioactive waste, proliferation risks, and fusion’s high-temperature requirements. JEE/NEET problems involve energy calculations or identifying risks. *University Physics* connects nuclear energy to sustainability.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves a power plant with 32% efficiency producing 500 MW from \( ^{235}\text{U} \) fission (200 MeV per fission). Calculate the mass of \( ^{235}\text{U} \) consumed per day.
- **Solution**: Output power: \( 500 \, \text{MW} = 500 \times 10^6 \, \text{J/s} \). Input power: \( \frac{500 \times 10^6}{0.32} \approx 1.5625 \times 10^9 \, \text{J/s} \). Energy per fission: \( 200 \times 10^6 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \approx 3.204 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{J} \). Fissions per second: \( \frac{1.5625 \times 10^9}{3.204 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 4.874 \times 10^{19} \). Per day: \( 4.874 \times 10^{19} \times 86400 \approx 4.211 \times 10^{24} \). Mass of \( ^{235}\text{U} \): \( 3.902 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg} \). Total mass: \( 4.211 \times 10^{24} \times 3.902 \times 10^{-25} \approx 0.1643 \, \text{kg} \approx 164 \, \text{g} \). This is a classic JEE application problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Account for efficiency; use fission energy. Common error: Omitting efficiency.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks a challenge of nuclear energy.
- **Solution**: A major challenge is **radioactive waste**, requiring safe long-term storage. Option (a) “Radioactive waste” is correct. This is a typical NEET challenge problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Focus on waste disposal; distinguish from safety. Common error: Assuming only proliferation.
