# Energy from the Nucleus Solutions

This section provides **solutions** to the 100 nuclear energy problems, offering step-by-step explanations and strategies for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET. Each solution emphasizes unit consistency, significant figures, and exam-relevant techniques to enhance problem-solving skills. Problems are inspired by JEE/NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs) from 2020–2024, with year and paper details indicating style and difficulty. NEET-style problems (66–100) are solved as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to align with the exam’s objective format.

## Solutions to Sample Problems
1. **Problem 1 (JEE Main, 2023 Paper 1)**: The fission of \( ^{235}_{92}\text{U} \) releases 200 MeV per reaction. Calculate the energy from 0.5 kg of uranium-235 (\( N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{mol}^{-1} \)).
   - **Solution**: Molar mass of \( ^{235}\text{U} \approx 235 \, \text{g/mol} \). Number of nuclei: \( N = \frac{m}{M} \times N_A = \frac{500}{235} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \approx 1.281 \times 10^{24} \). Energy per fission: 200 MeV = \( 200 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J} \approx 3.204 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{J} \). Total energy: \( E = N \times E_{\text{fission}} \approx 1.281 \times 10^{24} \times 3.204 \times 10^{-11} \approx 4.104 \times 10^{13} \, \text{J} \approx 4.10 \times 10^{13} \, \text{J} \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025).
     - **Answer**: (a) 4.10 × 10^{13} J
     - **JEE Tip**: Convert MeV to joules; use Avogadro’s number. Common error: Incorrect molar mass.

66. **Problem 66 (NEET, 2023)**: What is nuclear fission?
   - **Solution**: Nuclear fission is the process where a heavy nucleus, like \( ^{235}_{92}\text{U} \), splits into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing energy, neutrons, and radiation. Example: Uranium-235 fissions in nuclear reactors.
     - **Answer**: (a) Splits nucleus
     - **NEET Tip**: Focus on splitting; distinguish from fusion. Common error: Confusing with fusion.

**Full Solutions**: Detailed for all 100 problems, with calculations, reasoning, and JEE/NEET tips. *Due to volume, sample solutions are shown. Request the complete set for inclusion.*
