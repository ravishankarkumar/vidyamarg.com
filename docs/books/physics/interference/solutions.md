# Interference Solutions

This section provides **solutions** to the 100 wave interference problems, offering step-by-step explanations and strategies for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET. Each solution emphasizes unit consistency, significant figures, and exam-relevant techniques to enhance problem-solving skills. Problems are inspired by JEE/NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs) from 2020–2024, with year and paper details indicating style and difficulty. NEET-style problems (66–100) are solved as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to align with the exam’s objective format.

## Solutions to Sample Problems
1. **Problem 1 (JEE Main, 2023 Paper 1)**: Two coherent waves with wavelength 400 nm have a path difference of 800 nm. Determine the interference type.
   - **Solution**: Path difference: \( \Delta x = 800 \, \text{nm} \). Wavelength: \( \lambda = 400 \, \text{nm} \). Check: \( \Delta x = 800/400 = 2\lambda \), an integer multiple (m = 2). This satisfies constructive interference. Answer: **Constructive interference** (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025).
     - **Answer**: (a) Constructive
     - **JEE Tip**: Integer multiples of \( \lambda \) indicate constructive interference; ensure units match. Common error: Misinterpreting path difference.

66. **Problem 66 (NEET, 2023)**: What is superposition?
   - **Solution**: Superposition is the principle where the resultant displacement of overlapping waves is the sum of individual displacements, leading to interference patterns. Example: In Young’s experiment, waves from two slits superpose to form fringes.
     - **Answer**: (a) Wave addition
     - **NEET Tip**: Superposition is the basis of interference; distinguish from diffraction. Common error: Confusing with wave subtraction.
