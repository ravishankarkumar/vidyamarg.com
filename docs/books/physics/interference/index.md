# Chapter 35: Interference

Interference of light waves, resulting from their superposition, produces patterns of bright and dark regions, fundamental to understanding wave optics and applications like holography and interferometry. This chapter explores the principle of superposition and interference, Young’s double-slit experiment, thin film interference, and interference in optical devices. These concepts are critical for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET, appearing in problems on fringe patterns, path differences, and optical phenomena. With clear explanations, exam-focused examples, and robust problem-solving strategies, this chapter equips students to master interference in competitive exams, ensuring precision and conceptual clarity.

## 35.1 Principle of Superposition and Interference

The **principle of superposition** states that when two or more waves overlap, the resultant displacement is the sum of individual displacements. **Interference** occurs when coherent waves superpose, producing **constructive interference** (maxima) when path difference \( \Delta x = m\lambda \) (m = 0, ±1, ±2, ...) and **destructive interference** (minima) when \( \Delta x = (m + \frac{1}{2})\lambda \). JEE/NEET problems involve determining interference conditions or phase differences. *Fundamentals of Physics* emphasizes coherence for sustained interference.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves two coherent waves with wavelength 600 nm and path difference 1200 nm. Determine the type of interference.
- **Solution**: Path difference: \( \Delta x = 1200 \, \text{nm} = 1.2 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \). Wavelength: \( \lambda = 600 \, \text{nm} = 6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). Check: \( \Delta x = 1200/600 = 2\lambda \), an integer multiple (m = 2). This satisfies constructive interference. Answer: **Constructive interference**. This is a standard JEE interference problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Divide path difference by wavelength; integer multiples indicate constructive interference. Common error: Incorrect unit conversion.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks the condition for destructive interference.
- **Solution**: Destructive interference occurs when the path difference is an odd multiple of half the wavelength, i.e., **\( \Delta x = (m + \frac{1}{2})\lambda \)**. Option (a) “Odd multiple of half-wavelength” is correct. This is a typical NEET interference problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Destructive interference produces minima; check path difference. Common error: Confusing with constructive condition.

## 35.2 Young’s Double-Slit Experiment

**Young’s double-slit experiment** demonstrates interference, producing bright and dark fringes on a screen. For slits separated by distance \( d \), with light of wavelength \( \lambda \), and screen distance \( D \), the fringe spacing is \( \beta = \frac{\lambda D}{d} \). Bright fringes occur at \( y_m = m \frac{\lambda D}{d} \), dark fringes at \( y_m = (m + \frac{1}{2}) \frac{\lambda D}{d} \). JEE/NEET problems involve calculating fringe spacing or fringe positions. *University Physics* highlights the experiment’s role in proving light’s wave nature.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves Young’s double-slit setup with \( \lambda = 500 \, \text{nm} \), \( d = 0.2 \, \text{mm} \), and \( D = 1 \, \text{m} \). Calculate the fringe spacing.
- **Solution**: Fringe spacing: \( \beta = \frac{\lambda D}{d} \). Given \( \lambda = 500 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \), \( d = 0.2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} \), \( D = 1 \, \text{m} \): \( \beta = \frac{(500 \times 10^{-9}) \times 1}{0.2 \times 10^{-3}} = \frac{5 \times 10^{-7}}{2 \times 10^{-4}} = 2.5 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} = 2.5 \, \text{mm} \approx 2.50 \, \text{mm} \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025). This is a classic JEE double-slit problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Convert units to meters; divide carefully. Common error: Incorrect powers of 10.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks the condition for bright fringes in Young’s experiment.
- **Solution**: Bright fringes occur when the path difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength, i.e., **\( d \sin \theta = m \lambda \)** or positions \( y_m = m \frac{\lambda D}{d} \). Option (a) “Integer multiple of wavelength” is correct. This is a typical NEET double-slit problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Bright fringes are maxima; relate to constructive interference. Common error: Confusing with dark fringes.

## 35.3 Thin Film Interference

**Thin film interference** occurs when light reflects off the top and bottom surfaces of a thin film, with path difference \( 2nt \cos \theta \) (where \( n \) is the refractive index, \( t \) is thickness, \( \theta \) is the angle inside the film). Phase changes at boundaries affect constructive (\( 2nt = m\lambda \)) or destructive (\( 2nt = (m + \frac{1}{2})\lambda \)) conditions. JEE/NEET problems involve calculating film thickness or wavelengths for interference. *Fundamentals of Physics* connects thin films to colorful patterns in soap bubbles.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves a soap film (\( n = 1.33 \), thickness 400 nm) in air, illuminated by 532 nm light at normal incidence. Determine the interference type.
- **Solution**: Path difference: \( 2nt \). Given \( n = 1.33 \), \( t = 400 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \), \( \lambda = 532 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \): \( 2nt = 2 \times 1.33 \times 400 \times 10^{-9} = 1064 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} = 1.064 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \). Phase change occurs at the top surface (air to soap, \( n_{\text{air}} < n_{\text{soap}} \)), adding \( \lambda/2 \). Effective path difference: \( 2nt + \frac{\lambda}{2} = 1064 + 266 = 1330 \, \text{nm} \). Check: \( 1330/532 \approx 2.5 \), an odd multiple of \( \lambda/2 \), indicating destructive interference. Answer: **Destructive interference**. This is a standard JEE thin film problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Account for phase change; check path difference. Common error: Omitting phase shift.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks the cause of colors in a soap bubble.
- **Solution**: Colors in a soap bubble result from **thin film interference**, where light waves reflecting off the film’s surfaces interfere, producing wavelength-dependent patterns. Option (a) “Thin film interference” is correct. This is a typical NEET thin film problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Colors indicate wavelength-specific interference; relate to films. Common error: Confusing with diffraction.

## 35.4 Interference in Optical Devices

**Optical devices** like interferometers (e.g., Michelson interferometer) and air wedges use interference to measure distances or refractive indices. For an air wedge, fringe spacing is \( \beta = \frac{\lambda}{2 \tan \theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the wedge angle. JEE/NEET problems involve calculating fringe patterns or device parameters. *University Physics* connects interference to precision measurements in science.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves an air wedge formed by two glass plates with \( \lambda = 600 \, \text{nm} \), wedge angle \( \theta = 0.01 \, \text{rad} \). Calculate the fringe spacing.
- **Solution**: Fringe spacing: \( \beta = \frac{\lambda}{2 \tan \theta} \). Given \( \lambda = 600 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \), \( \theta = 0.01 \, \text{rad} \), \( \tan 0.01 \approx 0.01 \): \( \beta = \frac{600 \times 10^{-9}}{2 \times 0.01} = \frac{6 \times 10^{-7}}{0.02} = 3 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m} = 0.03 \, \text{mm} \approx 0.030 \, \text{mm} \). This is a classic JEE optical device problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Use small-angle approximation; convert to mm. Common error: Incorrect tangent value.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks the purpose of an interferometer.
- **Solution**: An interferometer uses **interference patterns** to measure precise distances or refractive indices. Option (a) “Measure distances” is correct. This is a typical NEET device problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Interferometers rely on interference; focus on precision. Common error: Confusing with diffraction devices.
