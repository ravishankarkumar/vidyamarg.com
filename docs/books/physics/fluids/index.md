# Chapter 14: Fluids

Fluids, encompassing liquids and gases, exhibit unique behaviors under forces, flowing and exerting pressure. This chapter explores density and pressure, fluids at rest (hydrostatics), fluids in motion (hydrodynamics), and Bernoulli’s equation. These concepts are essential for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET, appearing in problems involving buoyant forces, flow rates, and pressure differences. With clear explanations, exam-focused examples, and robust problem-solving strategies, this chapter equips students to master fluid mechanics in competitive exams, ensuring precision and conceptual clarity.

## 14.1 Density and Pressure

**Density** (\( \rho \)) is mass per unit volume: \( \rho = \frac{m}{V} \), typically in kg/m³. **Pressure** (\( P \)) is force per unit area: \( P = \frac{F}{A} \), in pascals (Pa, N/m²). In fluids, pressure is isotropic, acting equally in all directions. Atmospheric pressure at sea level is ~101325 Pa. JEE/NEET problems often involve calculating density or pressure in systems like tanks or barometers. *Fundamentals of Physics* emphasizes pressure’s role in fluid behavior.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves a 0.02 m³ block of iron (density 7800 kg/m³). Calculate its mass.
- **Solution**: Mass: \( m = \rho V \). Given \( \rho = 7800 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \), \( V = 0.02 \, \text{m}^3 \): \( m = 7800 \times 0.02 = 156 \, \text{kg} \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025). This is a standard JEE density problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Ensure volume in m³; multiply carefully. Common error: Incorrect unit conversion.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves a force of 500 N applied over 0.25 m² in a hydraulic system. Calculate the pressure.
- **Solution**: Pressure: \( P = \frac{F}{A} \). Given \( F = 500 \, \text{N} \), \( A = 0.25 \, \text{m}^2 \): \( P = \frac{500}{0.25} = 2000 \, \text{Pa} \) (2 significant figures). This is a typical NEET pressure problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Pressure in Pa; check area units. Common error: Dividing by incorrect area.

## 14.2 Fluids at Rest (Hydrostatics)

In fluids at rest, pressure increases with depth due to the weight of the fluid above: \( P = P_0 + \rho g h \), where \( P_0 \) is surface pressure, \( \rho \) is density, \( g \approx 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), and \( h \) is depth. **Buoyancy** arises from pressure differences, with buoyant force \( F_b = \rho_{\text{fluid}} V_{\text{sub}} g \). JEE/NEET problems involve pressure at depth or buoyant forces in submerged objects. *University Physics* highlights applications in biology (e.g., blood pressure), tested in NEET.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves a diver at 10 m depth in seawater (density 1030 kg/m³, atmospheric pressure 101325 Pa). Calculate the pressure.
- **Solution**: Pressure: \( P = P_0 + \rho g h \). Given \( P_0 = 101325 \, \text{Pa} \), \( \rho = 1030 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \), \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), \( h = 10 \, \text{m} \): \( P = 101325 + 1030 \times 9.8 \times 10 = 101325 + 100940 = 202265 \, \text{Pa} \approx 202000 \, \text{Pa} \) (3 significant figures). This is a classic JEE hydrostatics problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Include atmospheric pressure; use SI units. Common error: Omitting \( P_0 \) or incorrect density.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves a 0.01 m³ wood block (density 600 kg/m³) fully submerged in water (density 1000 kg/m³). Calculate the buoyant force.
- **Solution**: Buoyant force: \( F_b = \rho_{\text{fluid}} V_{\text{sub}} g \). Given \( \rho_{\text{fluid}} = 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \), \( V_{\text{sub}} = 0.01 \, \text{m}^3 \), \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \): \( F_b = 1000 \times 0.01 \times 9.8 = 98 \, \text{N} \) (2 significant figures). This is a typical NEET buoyancy problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Use fluid density, submerged volume. Common error: Using object’s density or partial submersion.

## 14.3 Fluids in Motion (Hydrodynamics)

Fluids in motion obey the **continuity equation** for incompressible fluids: \( A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2 \), ensuring constant flow rate. **Flow rate** (\( Q = A v \)) measures volume per unit time (m³/s). JEE/NEET problems involve calculating velocities or flow rates in pipes or vessels. *Fundamentals of Physics* emphasizes ideal fluid assumptions (non-viscous, incompressible).

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves water flowing through a pipe narrowing from 0.02 m² to 0.01 m² cross-sectional area, with inlet velocity 2 m/s. Calculate the outlet velocity.
- **Solution**: Continuity equation: \( A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2 \). Given \( A_1 = 0.02 \, \text{m}^2 \), \( v_1 = 2 \, \text{m/s} \), \( A_2 = 0.01 \, \text{m}^2 \): \( v_2 = \frac{A_1 v_1}{A_2} = \frac{0.02 \times 2}{0.01} = 4 \, \text{m/s} \) (2 significant figures). This is a standard JEE hydrodynamics problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Flow rate constant; smaller area increases velocity. Common error: Incorrect area ratio or assuming constant velocity.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves blood (density 1060 kg/m³) flowing at 0.5 m/s through an artery (cross-sectional area 0.0001 m²). Calculate the mass flow rate.
- **Solution**: Mass flow rate: \( \dot{m} = \rho A v \). Given \( \rho = 1060 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \), \( A = 0.0001 \, \text{m}^2 \), \( v = 0.5 \, \text{m/s} \): \( \dot{m} = 1060 \times 0.0001 \times 0.5 = 0.053 \, \text{kg/s} \) (2 significant figures). This is a typical NEET flow problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Mass flow uses density; check units. Common error: Using volume flow or incorrect area.

## 14.4 Bernoulli’s Equation

**Bernoulli’s equation** for an ideal fluid relates pressure, velocity, and height: \( P + \rho g h + \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 = \text{constant} \). It reflects energy conservation per unit volume, balancing pressure, gravitational potential, and kinetic energies. JEE/NEET problems involve pressure differences or velocities in flow systems (e.g., Venturi tubes). *University Physics* connects to engineering (e.g., aerodynamics), tested in JEE Advanced.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves water (density 1000 kg/m³) flowing through a horizontal pipe (constant height) with pressure 200000 Pa and velocity 1 m/s at one point. At a narrower section, velocity is 2 m/s. Calculate the pressure.
- **Solution**: Bernoulli’s equation: \( P_1 + \frac{1}{2} \rho v_1^2 = P_2 + \frac{1}{2} \rho v_2^2 \) (since \( h_1 = h_2 \)). Given \( P_1 = 200000 \, \text{Pa} \), \( v_1 = 1 \, \text{m/s} \), \( v_2 = 2 \, \text{m/s} \), \( \rho = 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \): \( P_2 = P_1 + \frac{1}{2} \rho (v_1^2 - v_2^2) = 200000 + \frac{1}{2} \times 1000 \times (1^2 - 2^2) = 200000 + 500 \times (1 - 4) = 200000 - 1500 = 198500 \, \text{Pa} \approx 199000 \, \text{Pa} \) (3 significant figures). This is a classic JEE Bernoulli problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Constant height simplifies equation; higher velocity lowers pressure. Common error: Incorrect velocity squared or sign error.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves air (density 1.2 kg/m³) flowing over an airplane wing at 50 m/s, with 40 m/s below. Calculate the pressure difference.
- **Solution**: Bernoulli’s equation (neglecting height difference): \( P_1 + \frac{1}{2} \rho v_1^2 = P_2 + \frac{1}{2} \rho v_2^2 \). Given \( v_1 = 50 \, \text{m/s} \) (top), \( v_2 = 40 \, \text{m/s} \) (bottom), \( \rho = 1.2 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \): \( P_2 - P_1 = \frac{1}{2} \rho (v_1^2 - v_2^2) = \frac{1}{2} \times 1.2 \times (50^2 - 40^2) = 0.6 \times (2500 - 1600) = 0.6 \times 900 = 540 \, \text{Pa} \) (2 significant figures). This is a typical NEET lift problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Faster flow reduces pressure; lift from pressure difference. Common error: Reversing velocities or omitting density.
