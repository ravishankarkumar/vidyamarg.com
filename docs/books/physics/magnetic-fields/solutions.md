# Magnetic Fields Solutions

This section provides **solutions** to the 100 magnetic fields problems, offering step-by-step explanations and strategies for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET. Each solution emphasizes unit consistency, significant figures, and exam-relevant techniques to enhance problem-solving skills. Problems are inspired by JEE/NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs) from 2020–2024, with year and paper details indicating style and difficulty. NEET-style problems (66–100) are solved as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to align with the exam’s objective format.

## Solutions to Sample Problems
1. **Problem 1 (JEE Main, 2023 Paper 1)**: An electron (\( q = -1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \)) moves at \( v = 4 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \) in +x-direction in a magnetic field \( \vec{B} = 0.3 \, \text{T} \) in +y-direction. Calculate the magnetic force magnitude.
   - **Solution**: Force: \( \vec{F} = q (\vec{v} \times \vec{B}) \). Cross product: \( \vec{v} \times \vec{B} = (4 \times 10^6 \hat{i}) \times (0.3 \hat{j}) = 1.2 \times 10^6 \hat{k} \, \text{T·m/s} \). Magnitude: \( F = |q| |\vec{v} \times \vec{B}| = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \times 1.2 \times 10^6 = 1.9224 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{N} \approx 1.92 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{N} \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025).
     - **Answer**: (a) 1.92 × 10⁻¹³ N
     - **JEE Tip**: Use right-hand rule; compute magnitude carefully. Common error: Incorrect cross product.

66. **Problem 66 (NEET, 2023)**: What is a magnetic field?
   - **Solution**: A magnetic field is a region around moving charges or currents exerting forces on other charges or currents, described by \( \vec{B} \). Example: A current-carrying wire produces a circular magnetic field.
     - **Answer**: (a) Field from currents
     - **NEET Tip**: Focus on field source; distinguish from electric field. Common error: Confusing with electric field.
