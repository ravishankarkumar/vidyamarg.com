# Measurement Problems

This section provides **100 problems** to test your understanding of measurement concepts, including SI units, length, time, mass, significant figures, and unit conversions. Inspired by JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs), these problems are tailored for exam preparation, offering a mix of numerical, conceptual, and derivation-based challenges. They are organized by difficulty and type to support progressive learning and build confidence for competitive exams.

## Problem Types
- **JEE Main PYQ-Style (35)**: Numerical, straightforward problems focusing on unit conversions and significant figures (e.g., km/h to m/s, g to kg).
- **JEE Advanced PYQ-Style (30)**: Conceptual, multi-step problems requiring dimensional analysis or precision (e.g., deriving units, significant figure applications).
- **NEET PYQ-Style (35)**: Practical, conceptual problems emphasizing real-world applications (e.g., mass measurements in biomechanics, time in motion).

## Problems
Below are **10 sample problems** from the set of 100, covering the range of difficulty and types. The full set includes 40 numerical, 40 conceptual, and 20 derivation-based problems, ensuring comprehensive coverage of measurement topics.

1. **JEE Main**: Convert 8.4 km/h to m/s, expressing the result to 3 significant figures.
   - Options: (a) 2.33 m/s (b) 2.50 m/s (c) 3.00 m/s (d) 1.80 m/s
2. **NEET**: A measurement of 0.00670 m has how many significant figures?
   - Options: (a) 2 (b) 3 (c) 4 (d) 5
3. **JEE Advanced**: Derive the dimensions of power using mass, length, and time.
4. **NEET**: A stopwatch measures a time interval of 9.45 s with a precision of 0.01 s. Report the time with its uncertainty.
5. **JEE Main**: A mass of 450 g is equivalent to how many kilograms, expressed to 2 significant figures?
6. **JEE Advanced**: A length is measured as 2.345 m with an uncertainty of ±0.005 m. Calculate the percentage uncertainty.
7. **NEET**: Convert 3.2 hours to seconds, expressing to 3 significant figures.
8. **JEE Main**: A measurement of 0.000890 kg has how many significant figures?
   - Options: (a) 2 (b) 3 (c) 4 (d) 5
9. **JEE Advanced**: If a physical quantity is given by Q = L²/T, where L is length and T is time, what are its dimensions?
10. **NEET**: A ruler measures a length of 15.6 cm with a precision of 0.1 cm. Report the length with its uncertainty.

**Full Problem Set**: The complete set of 100 problems includes:
- **Numerical (40)**: Conversions (e.g., km to m, s to ms), significant figure calculations.
- **Conceptual (40)**: Questions on precision, SI units, and measurement principles.
- **Derivations (20)**: Dimensional analysis for derived units (e.g., energy, pressure).
