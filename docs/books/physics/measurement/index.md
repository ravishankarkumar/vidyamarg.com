# Chapter 1: Measurement

Measurement is the cornerstone of physics, providing the tools to quantify the physical world with precision. This chapter explores the principles of measurement, including the International System of Units (SI), measurements of length, time, and mass, significant figures, and unit conversions. Designed for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET, these concepts are essential for solving numerical and conceptual problems across mechanics, electromagnetism, and other topics. The clear explanations and exam-focused examples prepare students for the rigor of competitive exams.

## 1.1 Measuring Things, Including Lengths

### What Is Physics?
Physics is the science of understanding nature’s fundamental laws, from the motion of celestial bodies to the interactions of subatomic particles. Measurement is central to this pursuit, enabling scientists to collect data, test hypotheses, and make predictions. For JEE and NEET students, mastering measurement ensures accuracy in calculations, such as determining displacements in kinematics or wavelengths in optics, where units and precision are frequently tested.

**Solved Example**: A student measures a desk’s length as 1.20 m using a ruler with 1 mm divisions. What is the measurement’s uncertainty?
- **Solution**: The ruler’s smallest division is 1 mm = 0.001 m. The uncertainty is typically ±1 division, so the length is 1.20 ± 0.001 m.

### Measuring Things
Physical quantities, such as length, time, or mass, are described by a numerical value and a unit (e.g., 10 meters). Standardized units ensure consistency across experiments, a critical skill for JEE/NEET problems involving unit conversions or dimensional analysis. Measurement requires selecting appropriate tools, such as rulers for length or balances for mass, and understanding their precision.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem requires the length of a wire in centimeters, but it’s measured as 2.5 m. Convert to centimeters.
- **Solution**: 1 m = 100 cm. Thus, 2.5 m = 2.5 × 100 = 250 cm.

### The International System of Units
The **International System of Units (SI)** defines seven base units, with three key for JEE/NEET:
- **Length**: Meter (m), defined by the distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 seconds.
- **Time**: Second (s), based on cesium atom vibrations (9,192,631,770 cycles).
- **Mass**: Kilogram (kg), defined via the Planck constant.

Derived units, such as velocity (m/s) or force (kg·m/s², newton), combine base units and are tested in mechanics and electromagnetism. *University Physics* highlights SI applications in modern technology, such as precise length measurements in semiconductor manufacturing.

**Solved Example**: A JEE problem uses a derived unit, pressure (N/m²). Express 1 N/m² in terms of base SI units.
- **Solution**: Newton (N) = kg·m/s². Thus, 1 N/m² = (kg·m/s²)/m² = kg·m⁻¹·s⁻².

### Changing Units
Unit conversions ensure consistency in calculations, using conversion factors where units cancel algebraically. For example:
- To convert kilometers to meters: 1 km = 1000 m, so 3 km = 3 × 1000 = 3000 m.
- To convert hours to seconds: 1 h = 3600 s, so 2 h = 2 × 3600 = 7200 s.

JEE/NEET problems often require conversions in kinematics (e.g., km/h to m/s) or optics (e.g., nm to m). *University Physics* emphasizes systematic conversions, such as in GPS systems requiring microseconds.

**Solved Example**: Convert 60 km/h to m/s for a JEE kinematics problem.
- **Solution**: 1 km = 1000 m, 1 h = 3600 s. Thus, 60 km/h = (60 × 1000) ÷ 3600 = 16.67 m/s (3 significant figures).

### Length
Length measures spatial extent, with the meter as the SI unit. Common prefixes include:
- Kilometer (km): 10³ m (e.g., geographical distances).
- Centimeter (cm): 10⁻² m (e.g., everyday objects).
- Nanometer (nm): 10⁻⁹ m (e.g., atomic or molecular scales).

Length is crucial in JEE/NEET for displacement, optical path lengths, and wavelength calculations. Modern examples include laser interferometry for nanoscale measurements (*University Physics*).

**Solved Example**: A NEET optics question involves a laser with a wavelength of 532 nm. Convert to meters.
- **Solution**: 1 nm = 10⁻⁹ m. Thus, 532 nm = 532 × 10⁻⁹ = 5.32 × 10⁻⁷ m.

### Significant Figures and Decimal Places
Significant figures indicate measurement precision, following these rules:
- Non-zero digits are significant (e.g., 789 has 3 significant figures).
- Zeros between non-zeros are significant (e.g., 1007 has 4).
- Leading zeros are not significant (e.g., 0.004 has 1).
- Trailing zeros with a decimal point are significant (e.g., 6.00 has 3).

In calculations, the result matches the input with the least significant figures. Example: 3.2 × 4.51 = 14.432, rounded to 14 (2 significant figures, limited by 3.2). JEE/NEET numerical answers often require correct significant figures, as emphasized in *Fundamentals of Physics*.

**Solved Example**: A JEE problem multiplies 0.056 and 2.4. What is the result to correct significant figures?
- **Solution**: 0.056 (2 significant figures) × 2.4 (2 significant figures) = 0.1344, rounded to 0.13 (2 significant figures).

## 1.2 Time

Time measures the duration of events, with the second (s) as the SI unit. Common prefixes include:
- Millisecond (ms): 10⁻³ s (e.g., reaction times).
- Microsecond (μs): 10⁻⁶ s (e.g., computer signals).
- Nanosecond (ns): 10⁻⁹ s (e.g., atomic processes).

Time is critical in JEE/NEET for kinematics (e.g., time of flight in projectiles), oscillations (e.g., period), and thermodynamics (e.g., reaction rates). *University Physics* notes atomic clocks, accurate to nanoseconds, enabling technologies like GPS navigation.

**Solved Example**: A NEET kinematics problem involves a sprinter running 100 m in 12 s. Calculate the average speed.
- **Solution**: Speed = distance ÷ time = 100 m ÷ 12 s = 8.33 m/s (3 significant figures, limited by 12 s).

## 1.3 Mass

Mass quantifies the amount of matter, with the kilogram (kg) as the SI unit. Prefixes include:
- Gram (g): 10⁻³ kg (e.g., small objects).
- Milligram (mg): 10⁻⁶ kg (e.g., chemical samples).

Mass is foundational in JEE/NEET for mechanics (e.g., Newton’s second law, F = ma), gravitation, and thermodynamics (e.g., gas laws). The kilogram’s definition via the Planck constant ensures universal precision, as detailed in *Fundamentals of Physics*.

**Solved Example**: A JEE dynamics problem involves a 0.75 kg object accelerating at 2 m/s². Calculate the force.
- **Solution**: F = ma = 0.75 × 2 = 1.5 N (2 significant figures, limited by 2 m/s²).

## Review & Summary
