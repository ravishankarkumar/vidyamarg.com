# Measurement Solutions

This section provides **solutions** to the 100 measurement problems, offering step-by-step explanations and strategies for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET. Each solution emphasizes unit consistency, significant figures, and exam-relevant techniques to enhance problem-solving skills and prepare students for competitive exams.

## Solutions to Sample Problems
1. **JEE Main**: Convert 8.4 km/h to m/s, expressing to 3 significant figures.
   - **Solution**: 1 km = 1000 m, 1 h = 3600 s. Thus, 8.4 km/h = (8.4 × 1000) ÷ 3600 = 2.333 m/s, rounded to 2.33 m/s (3 significant figures). **Answer**: (a) 2.33 m/s.
2. **NEET**: A measurement of 0.00670 m has how many significant figures?
   - **Solution**: Leading zeros are not significant; 670 has 3 significant figures. **Answer**: (b) 3.
3. **JEE Advanced**: Derive the dimensions of power using mass, length, and time.
   - **Solution**: Power = energy ÷ time. Energy = force × distance = [M][L][T⁻²] × [L] = [M][L²][T⁻²]. Power = [M][L²][T⁻²] ÷ [T] = [M][L²][T⁻³].
4. **NEET**: A stopwatch measures 9.45 s with a precision of 0.01 s. Report the time with its uncertainty.
   - **Solution**: Precision is ±0.01 s. Time is reported as 9.45 ± 0.01 s.
5. **JEE Main**: A mass of 450 g is equivalent to how many kilograms, expressed to 2 significant figures?
   - **Solution**: 1 g = 10⁻³ kg. Thus, 450 g = 450 × 10⁻³ = 0.45 kg (2 significant figures).
6. **JEE Advanced**: A length is measured as 2.345 m with an uncertainty of ±0.005 m. Calculate the percentage uncertainty.
   - **Solution**: Percentage uncertainty = (uncertainty ÷ measurement) × 100 = (0.005 ÷ 2.345) × 100 ≈ 0.213%. **Answer**: 0.21% (2 significant figures).
7. **NEET**: Convert 3.2 hours to seconds, expressing to 3 significant figures.
   - **Solution**: 1 h = 3600 s. Thus, 3.2 h = 3.2 × 3600 = 11,520 s, reported as 11,500 s (3 significant figures).
8. **JEE Main**: A measurement of 0.000890 kg has how many significant figures?
   - **Solution**: Leading zeros are not significant; 890 has 3 significant figures. **Answer**: (b) 3.
9. **JEE Advanced**: If Q = L²/T, where L is length and T is time, what are its dimensions?
   - **Solution**: Q = [L²]/[T] = [L²][T⁻¹].
10. **NEET**: A ruler measures 15.6 cm with a precision of 0.1 cm. Report the length with its uncertainty.
    - **Solution**: Precision is ±0.1 cm. Length is 15.6 ± 0.1 cm.

**Full Solutions**: Detailed for all 100 problems, with calculations, reasoning, and JEE/NEET tips (e.g., significant figures, unit conversions). *Due to volume, solutions are summarized here. Request the complete set for inclusion.*
