# Waves-2 Solutions

This section provides **solutions** to the 100 sound wave problems, offering step-by-step explanations and strategies for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET. Each solution emphasizes unit consistency, significant figures, and exam-relevant techniques to enhance problem-solving skills. Problems are inspired by JEE/NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs) from 2020–2024, with year and paper details indicating style and difficulty [Web:0, Web:8]. NEET-style problems (66–100) are solved as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to align with the exam’s objective format [Web:9, Web:15].

## Solutions to Sample Problems
1. **Problem 1 (JEE Main, 2023 Paper 1)**: A sound wave has a frequency of 256 Hz and speed of 343 m/s in air. Calculate the wavelength.
   - **Solution**: Wavelength: \( \lambda = \frac{v}{f} \). Given \( v = 343 \, \text{m/s} \), \( f = 256 \, \text{Hz} \): \( \lambda = \frac{343}{256} \approx 1.33984 \, \text{m} \approx 1.34 \, \text{m} \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025).
     - **Answer**: (b) 1.34 m
     - **JEE Tip**: Divide speed by frequency; use SI units. Common error: Using incorrect speed or frequency.

66. **Problem 66 (NEET, 2023)**: What defines a sound wave?
   - **Solution**: Sound waves are longitudinal, propagating through compressions and rarefactions in a medium (e.g., air, water). They involve particle vibrations parallel to wave direction. Example: Speaking creates sound via vocal cord vibrations. Option (a) correctly defines this.
     - **Answer**: (a) Longitudinal wave with compressions
     - **NEET Tip**: Focus on longitudinal nature; contrast with transverse waves. Common error: Assuming sound is transverse.
