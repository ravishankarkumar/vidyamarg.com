# Force and Motion—II Problems

This section provides **100 problems** to test your understanding of advanced force and motion concepts, including frictional forces, drag forces, terminal velocity, and forces in uniform circular motion. Inspired by JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs), these problems are tailored for exam preparation, offering a mix of numerical, conceptual, and derivation-based challenges. They are organized by difficulty and type to support progressive learning and build confidence for competitive exams.

## Problem Types
- **JEE Main PYQ-Style (35)**: Numerical, straightforward problems focusing on friction and circular motion (e.g., acceleration on rough inclines, centripetal force).
- **JEE Advanced PYQ-Style (30)**: Conceptual, multi-step problems requiring free-body diagrams and derivations (e.g., banked curves, terminal velocity equations).
- **NEET PYQ-Style (35)**: Practical, conceptual problems emphasizing real-world applications (e.g., drag forces in biomechanics, friction in medical scenarios).

## Problems
Below are **10 sample problems** from the set of 100, covering the range of difficulty and types. The full set includes 40 numerical, 40 conceptual, and 20 derivation-based problems, ensuring comprehensive coverage of force and motion topics.
