# Chapter 6: Force and Motion—II

Building on Newton’s laws, this chapter explores advanced force and motion concepts, including frictional forces, drag forces, terminal velocity, and forces in uniform circular motion. These topics are essential for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET, appearing in problems involving objects on rough surfaces, falling objects, and circular trajectories, such as vehicles on curved tracks or satellites in orbit. With clear explanations, exam-focused examples, and robust problem-solving strategies, this chapter equips students to tackle complex dynamics problems in competitive exams, ensuring precision and conceptual mastery.

## 6.1 Frictional Forces

### Kinetic and Static Friction
Friction opposes relative motion between surfaces in contact, classified as **kinetic friction** (when surfaces slide) and **static friction** (preventing motion). The frictional force is:
- **Kinetic**: \( \vec{f}_k = \mu_k \vec{N} \), where \( \mu_k \) is the coefficient of kinetic friction, and \( \vec{N} \) is the normal force.
- **Static**: \( \vec{f}_s \leq \mu_s \vec{N} \), where \( \mu_s \) is the coefficient of static friction, with \( \vec{f}_s \) adjusting to prevent motion up to a maximum.

Friction depends on surface properties, not contact area, and is critical in JEE/NEET problems involving blocks on inclines or rough surfaces.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves a 5 kg block sliding on a surface with \( \mu_k = 0.2 \), normal force 49 N (\( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)). Calculate the kinetic frictional force.
- **Solution**: \( f_k = \mu_k N = 0.2 \times 49 = 9.8 \, \text{N} \) (2 significant figures, April 14, 2025). This is a standard JEE numerical question on friction.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves a 10 kg block at rest on a surface with \( \mu_s = 0.4 \). Calculate the maximum static frictional force (\( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)).
- **Solution**: Normal force \( N = m g = 10 \times 9.8 = 98 \, \text{N} \). Maximum static friction \( f_s^{\text{max}} = \mu_s N = 0.4 \times 98 = 39.2 \, \text{N} \approx 39 \, \text{N} \) (2 significant figures). This is a typical NEET equilibrium question.

## 6.2 Drag Forces and Terminal Velocity

### Drag Forces
Drag forces oppose motion through a fluid (e.g., air, water), proportional to velocity at low speeds (\( \vec{f}_d \propto \vec{v} \)) or velocity squared at high speeds (\( \vec{f}_d \propto v^2 \)). In air, drag is significant for falling objects or vehicles. JEE/NEET problems often simplify drag as a constant or proportional force, especially in terminal velocity scenarios.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem models a 0.1 kg object falling with drag force \( f_d = 0.05 v \, \text{N} \) (v in m/s). Write the equation of motion (\( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)).
- **Solution**: Forces: Gravity \( F_g = m g = 0.1 \times 9.8 = 0.98 \, \text{N} \) (down), drag \( f_d = 0.05 v \) (up). Net force \( \sum F = F_g - f_d = m a \). Thus, \( 0.98 - 0.05 v = 0.1 a \), or \( a = \frac{0.98 - 0.05 v}{0.1} = 9.8 - 0.5 v \, \text{m/s}^2 \). This differential equation is tested in JEE Advanced.

### Terminal Velocity
Terminal velocity occurs when drag equals gravitational force, resulting in zero acceleration (\( \vec{v} = \text{constant} \)). For \( f_d = k v^2 \), terminal velocity \( v_t = \sqrt{\frac{m g}{k}} \). NEET problems often involve objects like raindrops or parachutists reaching terminal velocity. *University Physics* highlights applications in aerodynamics, relevant for JEE.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves a 50 kg skydiver with terminal velocity 60 m/s (\( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)). Calculate the drag coefficient \( k \) (\( f_d = k v^2 \)).
- **Solution**: At terminal velocity, \( f_d = m g \). Thus, \( k v_t^2 = m g \). \( k = \frac{m g}{v_t^2} = \frac{50 \times 9.8}{60^2} = \frac{490}{3600} \approx 0.136 \, \text{kg/m} \approx 0.14 \, \text{kg/m} \) (2 significant figures). This is a common NEET numerical.

## 6.3 Forces in Uniform Circular Motion

Uniform circular motion requires a **centripetal force**, directed toward the center, with magnitude \( F_c = \frac{m v^2}{r} \) or \( F_c = m r \omega^2 \), where \( v \) is speed, \( r \) is radius, and \( \omega \) is angular velocity. This force is provided by tension, gravity, friction, or normal forces. JEE/NEET problems involve scenarios like cars on banked curves or objects on rotating platforms.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves a 1000 kg car on a circular track (radius 50 m) at 20 m/s. Calculate the centripetal force.
- **Solution**: \( F_c = \frac{m v^2}{r} = \frac{1000 \times 20^2}{50} = \frac{1000 \times 400}{50} = 8000 \, \text{N} = 8 \, \text{kN} \) (2 significant figures). This is a standard JEE circular motion question, often involving friction or banking.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves a 0.5 kg ball tied to a 1 m string, rotating at 2 rad/s. Calculate the tension.
- **Solution**: Centripetal force \( F_c = m r \omega^2 = 0.5 \times 1 \times 2^2 = 0.5 \times 4 = 2 \, \text{N} \). Tension provides \( F_c \), so tension = 2 N (2 significant figures). This is a typical NEET problem on circular motion.

## 6.4 Applying Newton’s Laws with Friction and Circular Motion

Applying Newton’s laws to systems with friction or circular motion involves:
1. Drawing **free-body diagrams (FBDs)** to identify forces (e.g., friction, normal, tension).
2. Summing forces: \( \sum \vec{F} = m \vec{a} \) (dynamics) or \( \sum \vec{F} = 0 \) (equilibrium).
3. For circular motion, ensuring centripetal force \( \frac{m v^2}{r} \) is provided by real forces.
4. Solving for unknowns (e.g., acceleration, tension, minimum friction).

JEE/NEET problems often involve blocks on rough inclines, banked curves, or conical pendulums. *University Physics* notes real-world applications, like friction in vehicle safety systems.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves a 2 kg block on a rough 30° incline (\( \mu_k = 0.3 \), \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)). Calculate the acceleration down the incline.
- **Solution**: FBD: Gravity component down incline \( F_{\parallel} = m g \sin 30^\circ = 2 \times 9.8 \times 0.5 = 9.8 \, \text{N} \). Normal force \( N = m g \cos 30^\circ = 2 \times 9.8 \times 0.866 \approx 17.0 \, \text{N} \). Kinetic friction \( f_k = \mu_k N = 0.3 \times 17.0 = 5.1 \, \text{N} \). Net force = \( 9.8 - 5.1 = 4.7 \, \text{N} \). Acceleration \( a = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{4.7}{2} = 2.35 \, \text{m/s}^2 \approx 2.4 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (2 significant figures). This is a classic JEE incline problem.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves a 500 kg car on a banked curve (radius 40 m, \( \mu_s = 0.4 \)) at 15 m/s without slipping (\( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)). Calculate the banking angle.
- **Solution**: Centripetal force \( F_c = \frac{m v^2}{r} = \frac{500 \times 15^2}{40} = 2812.5 \, \text{N} \). Forces: Normal force components (\( N \sin\theta \) for centripetal, \( N \cos\theta \) balances gravity). Friction not needed if ideal banking. \( \tan\theta = \frac{v^2}{r g} = \frac{15^2}{40 \times 9.8} = \frac{225}{392} \approx 0.574 \). \( \theta = \tan^{-1}(0.574) \approx 29.9^\circ \approx 30^\circ \) (2 significant figures). This is a common NEET banking problem.

## Review & Summary
- **Frictional Forces**: Kinetic friction (\( f_k = \mu_k N \)) opposes sliding; static friction (\( f_s \leq \mu_s N \)) prevents motion, adjusting up to a maximum.
- **Drag Forces**: Oppose motion in fluids, proportional to velocity or \( v^2 \); terminal velocity occurs when drag equals gravity.
- **Circular Motion Forces**: Centripetal force \( F_c = \frac{m v^2}{r} \) provided by tension, friction, or gravity.
- **Applying Newton’s Laws**: Use FBDs, sum forces (\( \sum \vec{F} = m \vec{a} \)), and solve for unknowns in systems with friction or circular motion.
