# Gauss’s Law Solutions

This section provides **solutions** to the 100 Gauss’s law problems, offering step-by-step explanations and strategies for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET. Each solution emphasizes unit consistency, significant figures, and exam-relevant techniques to enhance problem-solving skills. Problems are inspired by JEE/NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs) from 2020–2024, with year and paper details indicating style and difficulty. NEET-style problems (66–100) are solved as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to align with the exam’s objective format.

## Solutions to Sample Problems
1. **Problem 1 (JEE Main, 2023 Paper 1)**: A point charge \( q = +4 \, \mu\text{C} \) at the origin. Calculate the electric flux through a sphere of radius 0.3 m centered at the origin (\( \epsilon_0 = 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{C}^2/\text{N·m}^2 \)).
   - **Solution**: Gauss’s law: \( \Phi_E = \frac{q_{\text{enc}}}{\epsilon_0} \). Given \( q = 4 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{C} \): \( \Phi_E = \frac{4 \times 10^{-6}}{8.854 \times 10^{-12}} \approx 4.516 \times 10^5 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C} \approx 4.52 \times 10^5 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C} \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025).
     - **Answer**: (b) 4.52 × 10⁵ N·m²/C
     - **JEE Tip**: Flux depends only on enclosed charge; radius irrelevant. Common error: Using surface area.

66. **Problem 66 (NEET, 2023)**: What is Gauss’s law?
   - **Solution**: Gauss’s law relates electric flux through a closed surface to the enclosed charge, \( \Phi_E = \frac{q_{\text{enc}}}{\epsilon_0} \). Example: Flux through a sphere around a point charge depends only on the charge inside.
     - **Answer**: (a) Relates flux to charge
     - **NEET Tip**: Focus on enclosed charge; distinguish from field strength.

**Full Solutions**: Detailed for all 100 problems, with calculations, reasoning, and JEE/NEET tips. *Due to volume, sample solutions are shown. Request the complete set for inclusion.*
