# Coulomb’s Law Solutions

This section provides **solutions** to the 100 Coulomb’s law problems, offering step-by-step explanations and strategies for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET. Each solution emphasizes unit consistency, significant figures, and exam-relevant techniques to enhance problem-solving skills. Problems are inspired by JEE/NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs) from 2020–2024, with year and paper details indicating style and difficulty [Web:0, Web:8]. NEET-style problems (66–100) are solved as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to align with the exam’s objective format [Web:9, Web:15].

## Solutions to Sample Problems
1. **Problem 1 (JEE Main, 2023 Paper 1)**: Two point charges \( q_1 = +4 \, \mu\text{C} \) and \( q_2 = -2 \, \mu\text{C} \) are 0.2 m apart. Calculate the force between them (\( k = 8.987 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \)).
   - **Solution**: Coulomb’s law: \( F = k \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2} \). Given \( q_1 = 4 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{C} \), \( q_2 = -2 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{C} \), \( r = 0.2 \, \text{m} \): \( |q_1 q_2| = 8 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{C}^2 \), \( r^2 = 0.04 \, \text{m}^2 \), \( F = 8.987 \times 10^9 \times \frac{8 \times 10^{-12}}{0.04} = 8.987 \times 10^9 \times 2 \times 10^{-10} = 1.7974 \, \text{N} \approx 1.80 \, \text{N} \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025). The force is attractive.
     - **Answer**: (b) 1.80 N
     - **JEE Tip**: Use magnitude for force; check units. Common error: Incorrect \( r^2 \) or sign.

66. **Problem 66 (NEET, 2023)**: What does Coulomb’s law describe?
   - **Solution**: Coulomb’s law describes the electrostatic force between two point charges, proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of their distance. Example: Two charged particles repel or attract based on their charge signs. Option (a) correctly defines this.
     - **Answer**: (a) Force between point charges
     - **NEET Tip**: Focus on force between charges; distinguish from field or motion. Common error: Confusing with electric field.
