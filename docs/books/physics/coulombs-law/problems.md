# Coulomb’s Law Problems

This section provides **100 problems** to test your understanding of Coulomb’s law, including electric charge, force calculations, superposition, electric fields, and field lines. Inspired by JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs) from 2020–2024, these problems are tailored for exam preparation, offering a mix of numerical, conceptual, and derivation-based challenges. Each problem includes the year and paper of inspiration (e.g., JEE Main 2023 Paper 1) to reflect its alignment with exam patterns, as requested (April 18, 2025). NEET-style problems (66–100) are formatted as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to match the exam’s objective format [Web:9, Web:15]. Problems are organized by difficulty and type to support progressive learning and build confidence.
