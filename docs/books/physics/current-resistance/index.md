# Chapter 26: Current and Resistance

Electric current and resistance govern the flow of charge through conductors, fundamental to circuit analysis. This chapter explores electric current and current density, resistance and Ohm’s law, power in electric circuits, and resistivity with temperature effects. These concepts are critical for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET, appearing in problems on circuit behavior, power dissipation, and material properties. With clear explanations, exam-focused examples, and robust problem-solving strategies, this chapter equips students to master current and resistance in competitive exams, ensuring precision and conceptual clarity.

## 26.1 Electric Current and Current Density

**Electric current** (\( I \)) is the rate of charge flow, defined as \( I = \frac{dQ}{dt} \), measured in amperes (A). **Current density** (\( \vec{J} \)) is current per unit area, \( J = \frac{I}{A} \), related to the electric field by \( J = \sigma E \), where \( \sigma \) is conductivity. JEE/NEET problems involve calculating current or current density. *Fundamentals of Physics* emphasizes current as a macroscopic phenomenon.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves a wire of cross-sectional area 2 mm² carrying a current of 5 A. Calculate the current density.
- **Solution**: Current density: \( J = \frac{I}{A} \). Given \( I = 5 \, \text{A} \), \( A = 2 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2 \): \( J = \frac{5}{2 \times 10^{-6}} = 2.5 \times 10^6 \, \text{A/m}^2 \approx 2.50 \times 10^6 \, \text{A/m}^2 \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025). This is a standard JEE current density problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Convert area to m²; ensure units match. Common error: Using mm² directly.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves a conductor with 10 C of charge passing in 5 s. Calculate the current.
- **Solution**: Current: \( I = \frac{Q}{t} \). Given \( Q = 10 \, \text{C} \), \( t = 5 \, \text{s} \): \( I = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \, \text{A} \). Option (a) “2 A” is correct. This is a typical NEET current problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Use base units; check time consistency. Common error: Misinterpreting charge.

## 26.2 Resistance and Ohm’s Law

**Resistance** (\( R \)) opposes current flow, defined by **Ohm’s law**: \( V = I R \), where \( V \) is potential difference, measured in ohms (\( \Omega \)). Resistance depends on material and geometry: \( R = \rho \frac{L}{A} \), where \( \rho \) is resistivity, \( L \) is length, and \( A \) is cross-sectional area. JEE/NEET problems involve calculating resistance or applying Ohm’s law. *University Physics* highlights Ohm’s law as an empirical relation.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves a copper wire (length 1 m, diameter 0.5 mm, resistivity \( \rho = 1.68 \times 10^{-8} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m} \)) connected to a 12 V battery. Calculate the current.
- **Solution**: Resistance: \( R = \rho \frac{L}{A} \). Area: \( A = \pi r^2 \), \( r = 0.25 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} \), \( A = \pi \times (0.25 \times 10^{-3})^2 \approx 1.963 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}^2 \). \( R = 1.68 \times 10^{-8} \times \frac{1}{1.963 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 0.0856 \, \Omega \). Current: \( I = \frac{V}{R} = \frac{12}{0.0856} \approx 140.2 \, \text{A} \approx 140 \, \text{A} \). This is a classic JEE resistance problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Convert diameter to radius; use Ohm’s law. Common error: Incorrect area calculation.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves a resistor with 6 V across it and 2 A current. Calculate the resistance.
- **Solution**: Resistance: \( R = \frac{V}{I} \). Given \( V = 6 \, \text{V} \), \( I = 2 \, \text{A} \): \( R = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \, \Omega \). Option (a) “3 Ω” is correct. This is a typical NEET Ohm’s law problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Apply Ohm’s law directly; check units. Common error: Swapping \( V \) and \( I \).

## 26.3 Power in Electric Circuits

**Power** (\( P \)) is the rate of energy transfer, given by \( P = I V = I^2 R = \frac{V^2}{R} \), measured in watts (W). Power dissipation in resistors converts electrical energy to heat. JEE/NEET problems involve calculating power or energy dissipation. *Fundamentals of Physics* connects power to circuit efficiency.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves a 10 Ω resistor with 2 A current. Calculate the power dissipated.
- **Solution**: Power: \( P = I^2 R \). Given \( I = 2 \, \text{A} \), \( R = 10 \, \Omega \): \( P = 2^2 \times 10 = 40 \, \text{W} \). This is a standard JEE power problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Square current; ensure resistance units. Common error: Using \( P = I V \) without voltage.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves a 5 Ω resistor connected to a 10 V source. Calculate the power dissipated.
- **Solution**: Power: \( P = \frac{V^2}{R} \). Given \( V = 10 \, \text{V} \), \( R = 5 \, \Omega \): \( P = \frac{10^2}{5} = 20 \, \text{W} \). Option (a) “20 W” is correct. This is a typical NEET power problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Use voltage-based formula; square voltage. Common error: Dividing incorrectly.

## 26.4 Resistivity and Temperature Effects

**Resistivity** (\( \rho \)) depends on material and temperature: \( \rho = \rho_0 [1 + \alpha (T - T_0)] \), where \( \alpha \) is the temperature coefficient of resistivity. Resistance changes as \( R = R_0 [1 + \alpha (T - T_0)] \). JEE/NEET problems involve calculating resistivity or resistance at different temperatures. *University Physics* connects resistivity to material science.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves a copper wire (\( R_0 = 0.1 \, \Omega \) at 20°C, \( \alpha = 3.9 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{°C}^{-1} \)) at 100°C. Calculate the new resistance.
- **Solution**: Resistance: \( R = R_0 [1 + \alpha (T - T_0)] \). Given \( R_0 = 0.1 \, \Omega \), \( T = 100 \, \text{°C} \), \( T_0 = 20 \, \text{°C} \): \( R = 0.1 \times [1 + 3.9 \times 10^{-3} \times (100 - 20)] = 0.1 \times [1 + 0.312] = 0.1312 \, \Omega \approx 0.131 \, \Omega \). This is a classic JEE temperature problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Use temperature difference; apply coefficient. Common error: Incorrect \( T_0 \).

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks how resistance changes with increasing temperature for a conductor (\( \alpha > 0 \)).
- **Solution**: Resistance increases with temperature: \( R = R_0 [1 + \alpha (T - T_0)] \). Option (a) “Increases” is correct. This is a typical NEET resistivity problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Know \( \alpha \) is positive for conductors. Common error: Assuming decrease.
