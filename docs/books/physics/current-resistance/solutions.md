# Current and Resistance Solutions

This section provides **solutions** to the 100 current and resistance problems, offering step-by-step explanations and strategies for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET. Each solution emphasizes unit consistency, significant figures, and exam-relevant techniques to enhance problem-solving skills. Problems are inspired by JEE/NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs) from 2020–2024, with year and paper details indicating style and difficulty. NEET-style problems (66–100) are solved as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to align with the exam’s objective format.

## Solutions to Sample Problems
1. **Problem 1 (JEE Main, 2023 Paper 1)**: A wire (cross-sectional area 1 mm²) carries 4 A. Calculate the current density.
   - **Solution**: Current density: \( J = \frac{I}{A} \). Given \( I = 4 \, \text{A} \), \( A = 1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2 \): \( J = \frac{4}{1 \times 10^{-6}} = 4 \times 10^6 \, \text{A/m}^2 \approx 4.00 \times 10^6 \, \text{A/m}^2 \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025).
     - **Answer**: (b) 4.00 × 10⁶ A/m²
     - **JEE Tip**: Convert mm² to m²; ensure units match. Common error: Using mm² directly.

66. **Problem 66 (NEET, 2023)**: What is electric current?
   - **Solution**: Electric current is the rate of charge flow, \( I = \frac{dQ}{dt} \), measured in amperes. Example: 10 C passing in 5 s gives \( I = 2 \, \text{A} \).
     - **Answer**: (a) Charge flow rate
     - **NEET Tip**: Focus on definition; distinguish from charge. Common error: Confusing with voltage.

**Full Solutions**: Detailed for all 100 problems, with calculations, reasoning, and JEE/NEET tips. *Due to volume, sample solutions are shown. Request the complete set for inclusion.*
