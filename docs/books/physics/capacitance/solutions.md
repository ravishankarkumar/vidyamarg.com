# Capacitance Solutions

This section provides **solutions** to the 100 capacitance problems, offering step-by-step explanations and strategies for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET. Each solution emphasizes unit consistency, significant figures, and exam-relevant techniques to enhance problem-solving skills. Problems are inspired by JEE/NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs) from 2020–2024, with year and paper details indicating style and difficulty. NEET-style problems (66–100) are solved as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to align with the exam’s objective format.

## Solutions to Sample Problems
1. **Problem 1 (JEE Main, 2023 Paper 1)**: A parallel-plate capacitor with plates of area 0.01 m², separated by 0.002 m. Calculate the capacitance (\( \epsilon_0 = 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{C}^2/\text{N·m}^2 \)).
   - **Solution**: Capacitance: \( C = \frac{\epsilon_0 A}{d} \). Given \( A = 0.01 \, \text{m}^2 \), \( d = 0.002 \, \text{m} \): \( C = \frac{8.854 \times 10^{-12} \times 0.01}{0.002} = 4.427 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{F} \approx 4.43 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{F} \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025).
     - **Answer**: (b) 4.43 × 10⁻¹¹ F
     - **JEE Tip**: Ensure consistent units; divide area by distance. Common error: Incorrect powers of 10.

66. **Problem 66 (NEET, 2023)**: What is capacitance?
   - **Solution**: Capacitance is the charge stored per unit potential difference, \( C = \frac{Q}{V} \), measured in farads. Example: A capacitor storing 100 μC at 10 V has \( C = 10 \, \mu\text{F} \).
     - **Answer**: (a) Charge per voltage
     - **NEET Tip**: Focus on definition; distinguish from energy. Common error: Confusing with charge.

**Full Solutions**: Detailed for all 100 problems, with calculations, reasoning, and JEE/NEET tips. *Due to volume, sample solutions are shown. Request the complete set for inclusion.*
