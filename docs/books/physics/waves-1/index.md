# Chapter 16: Waves-1

Waves describe the propagation of disturbances, carrying energy without transferring matter. This chapter explores mechanical wave types, the wave equation, superposition and interference, and standing waves. These concepts are essential for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET, appearing in problems on wave speed, interference patterns, and standing wave frequencies. With clear explanations, exam-focused examples, and robust problem-solving strategies, this chapter equips students to master wave mechanics in competitive exams, ensuring precision and conceptual clarity.

## 16.1 Wave Types and Properties

**Mechanical waves** require a medium (e.g., water, air) and include **transverse waves** (displacement perpendicular to propagation, e.g., string waves) and **longitudinal waves** (displacement parallel, e.g., sound). Key properties include **wavelength** (\( \lambda \)), **frequency** (\( f \)), **period** (\( T = \frac{1}{f} \)), **amplitude** (\( A \)), and **speed** (\( v = f \lambda \)). JEE/NEET problems often involve calculating wave speed or identifying wave types. *Fundamentals of Physics* emphasizes wave characteristics in various media.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves a transverse wave with frequency 10 Hz and wavelength 2 m. Calculate the wave speed.
- **Solution**: Wave speed: \( v = f \lambda \). Given \( f = 10 \, \text{Hz} \), \( \lambda = 2 \, \text{m} \): \( v = 10 \times 2 = 20 \, \text{m/s} \) (2 significant figures, April 14, 2025). This is a standard JEE wave speed problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Use SI units (Hz, m); multiply carefully. Common error: Confusing frequency with period.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves a longitudinal wave with period 0.05 s and speed 340 m/s. Calculate the wavelength.
- **Solution**: Wavelength: \( \lambda = v T \). Given \( T = 0.05 \, \text{s} \), \( v = 340 \, \text{m/s} \): \( \lambda = 340 \times 0.05 = 17 \, \text{m} \) (2 significant figures). Alternatively, \( f = \frac{1}{T} = \frac{1}{0.05} = 20 \, \text{Hz} \), \( \lambda = \frac{v}{f} = \frac{340}{20} = 17 \, \text{m} \). This is a typical NEET wavelength problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Use period or frequency; verify units. Common error: Incorrect period conversion.

## 16.2 Wave Equation and Speed

The **wave equation** for a traveling wave is \( y = A \sin(k x - \omega t + \phi) \), where \( k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \) (wave number), \( \omega = 2 \pi f \) (angular frequency), and \( \phi \) is phase. Wave speed in a medium depends on properties: for a string, \( v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} \), where \( T \) is tension and \( \mu \) is linear mass density; for longitudinal waves, \( v = \sqrt{\frac{B}{\rho}} \), where \( B \) is bulk modulus and \( \rho \) is density. JEE/NEET problems involve calculating \( v \) or \( k \). *University Physics* connects wave speed to material properties.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves a string (tension 100 N, mass per unit length 0.01 kg/m). Calculate the wave speed.
- **Solution**: Wave speed: \( v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} \). Given \( T = 100 \, \text{N} \), \( \mu = 0.01 \, \text{kg/m} \): \( v = \sqrt{\frac{100}{0.01}} = \sqrt{10000} = 100 \, \text{m/s} \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025). This is a classic JEE string wave problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Use SI units; simplify square root. Common error: Incorrect \( \mu \) or forgetting square root.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves a wave \( y = 0.02 \sin(2 \pi x - 50 \pi t) \) m. Calculate the wave number.
- **Solution**: Wave equation: \( y = A \sin(k x - \omega t) \). Given equation: \( y = 0.02 \sin(2 \pi x - 50 \pi t) \), so \( k = 2 \pi \, \text{rad/m} \approx 6.2832 \, \text{rad/m} \approx 6.3 \, \text{rad/m} \) (2 significant figures). This is a typical NEET wave parameter problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Identify \( k \) from the coefficient of \( x \); units are rad/m. Common error: Confusing \( k \) with \( \omega \).

## 16.3 Superposition and Interference

**Superposition** states that the net displacement of overlapping waves is the sum of individual displacements. **Constructive interference** occurs when crests align, increasing amplitude; **destructive interference** occurs when a crest meets a trough, reducing amplitude. For two waves with phase difference \( \Delta \phi \), resultant amplitude depends on \( \cos(\Delta \phi / 2) \). JEE/NEET problems involve interference patterns or path differences. *Fundamentals of Physics* highlights interference in wave interactions.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves two waves \( y_1 = 0.01 \sin(\omega t - k x) \) and \( y_2 = 0.01 \sin(\omega t - k x + \pi/2) \). Calculate the resultant amplitude.
- **Solution**: Resultant amplitude: \( A_R = \sqrt{A_1^2 + A_2^2 + 2 A_1 A_2 \cos(\Delta \phi)} \). Given \( A_1 = A_2 = 0.01 \, \text{m} \), \( \Delta \phi = \pi/2 \): \( A_R = \sqrt{(0.01)^2 + (0.01)^2 + 2 \times 0.01 \times 0.01 \times \cos(\pi/2)} = \sqrt{0.0001 + 0.0001 + 0} = \sqrt{0.0002} \approx 0.01414 \, \text{m} \approx 0.014 \, \text{m} \) (2 significant figures). This is a standard JEE interference problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Use phase difference; \( \cos(\pi/2) = 0 \). Common error: Incorrect phase or amplitude summation.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves two waves interfering with a path difference of \( \lambda/4 \). What is the phase difference?
- **Solution**: Phase difference: \( \Delta \phi = \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} \cdot \Delta x \). Given \( \Delta x = \lambda/4 \): \( \Delta \phi = \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} \cdot \frac{\lambda}{4} = \frac{2 \pi}{4} = \frac{\pi}{2} \, \text{rad} \). This is a typical NEET interference problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Convert path difference to phase using \( 2 \pi / \lambda \). Common error: Incorrect fraction or units.

## 16.4 Standing Waves

**Standing waves** form when two identical waves traveling in opposite directions interfere, creating **nodes** (zero displacement) and **antinodes** (maximum displacement). For a string fixed at both ends, frequencies are \( f_n = \frac{n v}{2 L} \), where \( n \) is the harmonic number, \( v \) is wave speed, and \( L \) is length. JEE/NEET problems involve calculating frequencies or node positions. *University Physics* connects standing waves to musical instruments.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves a string (length 1 m, wave speed 50 m/s) fixed at both ends. Calculate the third harmonic frequency.
- **Solution**: Frequency: \( f_n = \frac{n v}{2 L} \). Given \( n = 3 \), \( v = 50 \, \text{m/s} \), \( L = 1 \, \text{m} \): \( f_3 = \frac{3 \times 50}{2 \times 1} = \frac{150}{2} = 75 \, \text{Hz} \) (2 significant figures). This is a classic JEE standing wave problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Use harmonic formula; \( n = 3 \) for third harmonic. Common error: Incorrect \( n \) or length.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves a standing wave on a string (length 0.5 m) with 3 nodes. Calculate the number of antinodes.
- **Solution**: A standing wave with 3 nodes (including ends for fixed string) has 2 segments, corresponding to the second harmonic (\( n = 2 \)). Number of antinodes equals \( n \), so for \( n = 2 \), there are 2 antinodes. This is a typical NEET standing wave problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Nodes include endpoints; antinodes equal harmonic number. Common error: Counting nodes incorrectly.

## Review & Summary
- **Wave Types**: Transverse (perpendicular displacement), longitudinal (parallel); properties: \( \lambda \), \( f \), \( T \), \( A \), \( v = f \lambda \).
- **Wave Equation**: \( y = A \sin(k x - \omega t + \phi) \); speed: \( v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} \) (string), \( \sqrt{\frac{B}{\rho}} \) (longitudinal).
- **Superposition**: Net displacement is sum; constructive/destructive interference based on phase.
