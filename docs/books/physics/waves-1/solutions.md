# Waves-1 Solutions

This section provides **solutions** to the 100 waves problems, offering step-by-step explanations and strategies for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET. Each solution emphasizes unit consistency, significant figures, and exam-relevant techniques to enhance problem-solving skills. Problems are inspired by JEE/NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs) from 2020–2024, with year and paper details indicating style and difficulty [Web:0, Web:8]. NEET-style problems (66–100) are solved as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to align with the exam’s objective format [Web:9, Web:15].

## Solutions to Sample Problems
1. **Problem 1 (JEE Main, 2023 Paper 1)**: A transverse wave has a frequency of 8 Hz and wavelength of 1.5 m. Calculate the wave speed.
   - **Solution**: Wave speed: \( v = f \lambda \). Given \( f = 8 \, \text{Hz} \), \( \lambda = 1.5 \, \text{m} \): \( v = 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \, \text{m/s} \) (2 significant figures, April 14, 2025).
     - **Answer**: (b) 12 m/s
     - **JEE Tip**: Multiply frequency and wavelength; use SI units. Common error: Confusing frequency with period.

66. **Problem 66 (NEET, 2023)**: What defines a mechanical wave?
   - **Solution**: A mechanical wave requires a medium (e.g., water, air) to propagate, unlike electromagnetic waves. It transfers energy through particle vibrations. Example: Sound waves need air; water waves need water. Option (a) correctly defines this.
     - **Answer**: (a) Requires a medium for propagation
     - **NEET Tip**: Focus on medium requirement; contrast with electromagnetic waves. Common error: Assuming all waves need a medium.

**Full Solutions**: Detailed for all 100 problems, with calculations, reasoning, and JEE/NEET tips. *Due to volume, sample solutions are shown. Request the complete set for inclusion.*
