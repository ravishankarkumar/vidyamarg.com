# More About Matter Waves Solutions

This section provides **solutions** to the 100 advanced matter wave problems, offering step-by-step explanations and strategies for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET. Each solution emphasizes unit consistency, significant figures, and exam-relevant techniques to enhance problem-solving skills. Problems are inspired by JEE/NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs) from 2020–2024, with year and paper details indicating style and difficulty. NEET-style problems (66–100) are solved as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to align with the exam’s objective format.

## Solutions to Sample Problems
1. **Problem 1 (JEE Main, 2023 Paper 1)**: An electron has a position uncertainty of 0.05 nm. Calculate the minimum momentum uncertainty (\( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)).
   - **Solution**: Uncertainty principle: \( \Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} \), where \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \approx \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 3.1416} \approx 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). Minimum: \( \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x} \). Given \( \Delta x = 0.05 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \): \( \Delta p \geq \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 0.05 \times 10^{-9}} = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-10}} = 1.055 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{kg·m/s} \approx 1.06 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{kg·m/s} \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025).
     - **Answer**: (b) 1.06 × 10^{-24} kg·m/s
     - **JEE Tip**: Use \( \hbar \); convert to SI units. Common error: Forgetting factor of 2.

66. **Problem 66 (NEET, 2023)**: What is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle?
   - **Solution**: The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that position and momentum cannot be measured simultaneously with arbitrary precision, given by \( \Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} \), reflecting the quantum nature of particles. Example: Measuring an electron’s position precisely increases momentum uncertainty.
     - **Answer**: (a) Measurement limit
     - **NEET Tip**: Focus on quantum limits; distinguish from classical physics. Common error: Assuming classical precision.

**Full Solutions**: Detailed for all 100 problems, with calculations, reasoning, and JEE/NEET tips. *Due to volume, sample solutions are shown. Request the complete set for inclusion.*
