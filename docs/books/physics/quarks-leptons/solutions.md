# Quarks, Leptons, and the Big Bang Solutions

This section provides **solutions** to the 100 particle physics and cosmology problems, offering step-by-step explanations and strategies for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET. Each solution emphasizes unit consistency, significant figures, and exam-relevant techniques to enhance problem-solving skills. Problems are inspired by JEE/NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs) from 2020–2024, with year and paper details indicating style and difficulty. NEET-style problems (66–100) are solved as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to align with the exam’s objective format.

## Solutions to Sample Problems
1. **Problem 1 (JEE Main, 2023 Paper 1)**: Calculate the charge of a neutron, composed of one up quark and two down quarks.
   - **Solution**: Quark charges: up (\( +\frac{2}{3}e \)), down (\( -\frac{1}{3}e \)). Neutron (udd): \( \frac{2}{3} + 2 \times (-\frac{1}{3}) = \frac{2}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = 0 \). Answer: **0**. Option (a) “0” is correct. This is a standard JEE particle problem (3 significant figures not applicable, April 14, 2025).
     - **JEE Tip**: Sum quark charges; neutron is udd. Common error: Confusing with proton (uud).
     - **Answer**: (a) 0

66. **Problem 66 (NEET, 2023)**: What are leptons?
   - **Solution**: Leptons are elementary particles, such as electrons, muons, and neutrinos, with integer charges (e.g., electron: \( -e \)) and no strong force interactions. Example: Electrons in atoms are leptons, unlike quarks in protons.
     - **Answer**: (a) Electron-like particles
     - **NEET Tip**: Leptons include electrons; distinguish from quarks in hadrons. Common error: Assuming quark-like.

**Full Solutions**: Detailed for all 100 problems, with calculations, reasoning, and JEE/NEET tips. *Due to volume, sample solutions are shown. Request the complete set for inclusion.*
