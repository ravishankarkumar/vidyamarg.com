# Diffraction Solutions

This section provides **solutions** to the 100 wave diffraction problems, offering step-by-step explanations and strategies for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET. Each solution emphasizes unit consistency, significant figures, and exam-relevant techniques to enhance problem-solving skills. Problems are inspired by JEE/NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs) from 2020–2024, with year and paper details indicating style and difficulty. NEET-style problems (66–100) are solved as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to align with the exam’s objective format.

## Solutions to Sample Problems
1. **Problem 1 (JEE Main, 2023 Paper 1)**: Light of wavelength 500 nm passes through a slit of width 0.1 mm. Calculate the angular position of the first diffraction minimum.
   - **Solution**: Minima: \( a \sin \theta = m \lambda \), \( m = 1 \). Given \( \lambda = 500 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \), \( a = 0.1 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} \): \( \sin \theta = \frac{\lambda}{a} = \frac{500 \times 10^{-9}}{0.1 \times 10^{-3}} = 5 \times 10^{-3} \). Small angle: \( \theta \approx 5 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{rad} \). Convert: \( \theta \approx 5 \times 10^{-3} \times \frac{180}{\pi} \approx 0.286^\circ \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025).
     - **Answer**: (a) 0.286°
     - **JEE Tip**: Use small-angle approximation; convert to degrees. Common error: Incorrect \( m \).

66. **Problem 66 (NEET, 2023)**: What causes diffraction?
   - **Solution**: Diffraction is caused by the bending of waves around obstacles or through apertures, resulting from the superposition of wavelets (Huygens’ principle). Example: Light passing through a narrow slit spreads into a pattern.
     - **Answer**: (a) Wave bending
     - **NEET Tip**: Diffraction is a wave property; distinguish from refraction. Common error: Confusing with reflection.
