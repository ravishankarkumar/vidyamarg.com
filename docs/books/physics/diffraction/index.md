# Chapter 36: Diffraction

Diffraction, the bending of light around obstacles or through apertures, produces characteristic patterns that reveal the wave nature of light, enabling applications like spectroscopy and high-resolution imaging. This chapter explores the nature and principles of diffraction, single-slit diffraction, diffraction gratings, and applications such as optical resolution and X-ray diffraction. These concepts are critical for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET, appearing in problems on minima positions, grating spectra, and resolving power. With clear explanations, exam-focused examples, and robust problem-solving strategies, this chapter equips students to master diffraction in competitive exams, ensuring precision and conceptual clarity.

## 36.1 Nature and Principles of Diffraction

**Diffraction** occurs when waves encounter an obstacle or aperture comparable to their wavelength, causing bending and interference. For light, diffraction patterns arise from the superposition of wavelets (Huygens’ principle). The extent of diffraction increases with the ratio \( \lambda/a \), where \( \lambda \) is the wavelength and \( a \) is the aperture size. JEE/NEET problems involve identifying diffraction conditions or pattern characteristics. *Fundamentals of Physics* emphasizes diffraction as a wave phenomenon distinct from geometric optics.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves light of wavelength 600 nm passing through a slit of width 0.2 mm. Calculate the angular position of the first diffraction minimum.
- **Solution**: Single-slit diffraction minima occur at \( a \sin \theta = m \lambda \), where \( m = 1 \) for the first minimum. Given \( \lambda = 600 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \), \( a = 0.2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} \): \( \sin \theta = \frac{\lambda}{a} = \frac{600 \times 10^{-9}}{0.2 \times 10^{-3}} = 3 \times 10^{-3} \). For small angles, \( \sin \theta \approx \theta \) (in radians), so \( \theta \approx 3 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{rad} \approx 0.172^\circ \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025). This is a standard JEE diffraction problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Use small-angle approximation; convert units to meters. Common error: Incorrect \( m \) value.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks why diffraction occurs.
- **Solution**: Diffraction occurs due to the **bending of waves** around obstacles or through apertures, resulting from wave superposition. Option (a) “Wave bending” is correct. This is a typical NEET diffraction problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Diffraction requires wave nature; relate to aperture size. Common error: Confusing with refraction.

## 36.2 Single-Slit Diffraction

**Single-slit diffraction** produces a central maximum flanked by minima at angles given by \( a \sin \theta = m \lambda \) (m = ±1, ±2, ...). The central maximum’s angular width is \( 2\theta_1 \approx \frac{2\lambda}{a} \). Intensity decreases with angle, described by \( I = I_0 \left( \frac{\sin \alpha}{\alpha} \right)^2 \), where \( \alpha = \frac{\pi a \sin \theta}{\lambda} \). JEE/NEET problems involve calculating minima positions or pattern width. *University Physics* highlights the role of slit width in pattern spread.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves a single slit of width 0.1 mm illuminated by 500 nm light, with a screen 2 m away. Calculate the width of the central maximum.
- **Solution**: Central maximum width is twice the distance to the first minimum: \( w = 2 y_1 \). First minimum: \( a \sin \theta = \lambda \). Given \( a = 0.1 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} \), \( \lambda = 500 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \): \( \sin \theta = \frac{\lambda}{a} = \frac{500 \times 10^{-9}}{0.1 \times 10^{-3}} = 5 \times 10^{-3} \). Small angle: \( \theta \approx 5 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{rad} \). Position: \( y_1 = D \tan \theta \approx D \theta = 2 \times 5 \times 10^{-3} = 0.01 \, \text{m} \). Width: \( w = 2 \times 0.01 = 0.02 \, \text{m} = 20 \, \text{mm} \approx 20.0 \, \text{mm} \). This is a classic JEE single-slit problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Double the first minimum position; use small-angle approximation. Common error: Incorrect distance units.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks the condition for single-slit diffraction minima.
- **Solution**: Minima occur when **\( a \sin \theta = m \lambda \)** (m = ±1, ±2, ...), causing destructive interference. Option (a) “\( a \sin \theta = m \lambda \)” is correct. This is a typical NEET single-slit problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Minima are dark regions; relate to path difference. Common error: Confusing with interference maxima.

## 36.3 Diffraction Gratings

**Diffraction gratings** consist of many slits, producing sharp maxima at angles given by \( d \sin \theta = m \lambda \), where \( d \) is the grating spacing and \( m \) is the order. The number of slits \( N \) determines the sharpness, and resolving power is \( R = \lambda / \Delta \lambda = Nm \). JEE/NEET problems involve calculating maxima angles or resolving power. *Fundamentals of Physics* connects gratings to spectroscopy.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves a diffraction grating with 5000 lines/cm illuminated by 600 nm light. Calculate the angle of the second-order maximum.
- **Solution**: Grating spacing: \( d = \frac{1}{5000} \, \text{cm} = 2 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \). Maxima: \( d \sin \theta = m \lambda \). Given \( \lambda = 600 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \), \( m = 2 \): \( \sin \theta = \frac{m \lambda}{d} = \frac{2 \times 600 \times 10^{-9}}{2 \times 10^{-6}} = \frac{1200 \times 10^{-9}}{2 \times 10^{-6}} = 0.6 \). Thus, \( \theta = \sin^{-1}(0.6) \approx 36.87^\circ \approx 36.9^\circ \). This is a standard JEE grating problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Convert lines/cm to \( d \); use correct order. Common error: Incorrect \( m \).

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks the purpose of a diffraction grating.
- **Solution**: A diffraction grating **separates light into spectra** by producing order-dependent maxima. Option (a) “Produces spectra” is correct. This is a typical NEET grating problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Gratings are used in spectroscopy; focus on maxima. Common error: Confusing with prisms.

## 36.4 Applications of Diffraction

**Applications** include optical resolution (Rayleigh criterion: \( \theta_R = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D} \)), X-ray diffraction for crystal structures (Bragg’s law: \( 2d \sin \theta = m \lambda \)), and spectroscopy. JEE/NEET problems involve calculating resolution limits or Bragg angles. *University Physics* highlights diffraction’s role in scientific and technological advancements.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves a telescope with aperture diameter 1 m observing stars at 550 nm. Calculate the minimum angular separation for resolution.
- **Solution**: Rayleigh criterion: \( \theta_R = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D} \). Given \( \lambda = 550 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \), \( D = 1 \, \text{m} \): \( \theta_R = 1.22 \times \frac{550 \times 10^{-9}}{1} = 6.71 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{rad} \approx 6.71 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{rad} \). This is a classic JEE resolution problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Use radians; ensure wavelength in meters. Common error: Omitting 1.22 factor.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks the use of X-ray diffraction.
- **Solution**: X-ray diffraction is used to **study crystal structures** via Bragg’s law. Option (a) “Crystal structure analysis” is correct. This is a typical NEET application problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Relate X-ray diffraction to Bragg’s law; focus on crystals. Common error: Confusing with spectroscopy.
