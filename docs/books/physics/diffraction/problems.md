# Diffraction Problems

This section provides **100 problems** to test your understanding of wave diffraction, including single-slit diffraction, diffraction gratings, and applications like optical resolution and X-ray diffraction. Inspired by JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs) from 2020–2024, these problems are tailored for exam preparation, offering a mix of numerical, conceptual, and derivation-based challenges. Each problem includes the year and paper of inspiration (e.g., JEE Main 2023 Paper 1) to reflect its alignment with exam patterns. NEET-style problems (66–100) are formatted as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to match the exam’s objective format. Problems are organized by difficulty and type to support progressive learning and build confidence.

## Problem Types
