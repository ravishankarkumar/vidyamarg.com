# Chapter 7: Kinetic Energy and Work

Work and kinetic energy provide a powerful framework for analyzing motion through energy transfer, connecting forces to an object’s speed and position. This chapter explores the work-energy theorem, kinetic energy, work done by gravitational and spring forces, and power. These concepts are essential for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET, appearing in problems involving objects sliding down inclines, spring systems, and mechanical power in engines. With clear explanations, exam-focused examples, and robust problem-solving strategies, this chapter equips students to master energy-based problems in competitive exams, ensuring precision and conceptual depth.

## 7.1 Work and the Work-Energy Theorem

### Work
Work is the energy transferred by a force acting over a displacement, defined as \( W = \vec{F} \cdot \vec{d} = F d \cos\theta \), where \( \vec{F} \) is the force, \( \vec{d} \) is the displacement, and \( \theta \) is the angle between them. Work is a scalar, measured in joules (J, N·m = kg·m²/s²). If \( \theta = 90^\circ \), \( W = 0 \) (e.g., normal force on a horizontal surface). JEE/NEET problems often involve calculating work for forces at angles or in multi-force systems.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves a 10 N force pulling a block 5 m at 30° to the horizontal. Calculate the work done.
- **Solution**: \( W = F d \cos\theta = 10 \times 5 \times \cos 30^\circ = 10 \times 5 \times 0.866 \approx 43.3 \, \text{J} \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025). This is a standard JEE work calculation.

### Work-Energy Theorem
The work-energy theorem states that the net work done on an object equals the change in its kinetic energy: \( W_{\text{net}} = \Delta K = K_f - K_i \), where \( K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \). This theorem links forces to motion, widely tested in JEE/NEET for scenarios like objects under friction or gravity.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves a 2 kg block initially at 4 m/s, slowed by a 6 N force over 3 m (opposite to motion). Calculate the final speed.
- **Solution**: Work done \( W = \vec{F} \cdot \vec{d} = -6 \times 3 = -18 \, \text{J} \) (negative due to opposite direction). Initial kinetic energy \( K_i = \frac{1}{2} m v_i^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4^2 = 16 \, \text{J} \). By work-energy theorem, \( W_{\text{net}} = \Delta K \), so \( K_f = K_i + W = 16 - 18 = -2 \, \text{J} \) (impossible, so block stops). Final speed = 0 m/s. This is a typical NEET problem.

## 7.2 Kinetic Energy

Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, given by \( K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \), where \( m \) is mass (kg) and \( v \) is speed (m/s), measured in joules. It depends on speed squared, so doubling speed quadruples kinetic energy. JEE/NEET problems often involve calculating kinetic energy changes due to forces, such as in collisions or inclines. *University Physics* highlights applications in vehicle crash analysis, tested in advanced JEE questions.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves a 0.5 kg ball moving at 10 m/s. Calculate its kinetic energy.
- **Solution**: \( K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.5 \times 10^2 = 0.5 \times 50 = 25 \, \text{J} \) (2 significant figures, April 14, 2025). This is a straightforward JEE numerical.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves a 3 kg object accelerating from 2 m/s to 5 m/s. Calculate the change in kinetic energy.
- **Solution**: Initial \( K_i = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 2^2 = 6 \, \text{J} \). Final \( K_f = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 5^2 = 37.5 \, \text{J} \). Change \( \Delta K = K_f - K_i = 37.5 - 6 = 31.5 \, \text{J} \approx 32 \, \text{J} \) (2 significant figures). This is a common NEET energy question.

## 7.3 Work Done by Gravitational and Spring Forces

### Gravitational Work
Work done by gravity is \( W_g = \vec{F}_g \cdot \vec{d} = -m g h \), where \( h \) is the vertical displacement (positive upward), and the negative sign accounts for gravity’s downward direction. If the displacement is horizontal, \( W_g = 0 \). JEE/NEET problems often involve gravitational work in inclines or vertical motion.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves a 2 kg object lifted 4 m vertically (\( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)). Calculate the work done by gravity.
- **Solution**: \( W_g = -m g h = -2 \times 9.8 \times 4 = -78.4 \, \text{J} \approx -78 \, \text{J} \) (2 significant figures). The negative work indicates opposition to upward motion, a typical JEE question.

### Spring Forces
The force of a spring is \( \vec{F}_s = -k \vec{x} \), where \( k \) is the spring constant (N/m) and \( \vec{x} \) is displacement from equilibrium. Work done by the spring is \( W_s = -\frac{1}{2} k x^2 \) (for displacement from equilibrium to \( x \)). JEE/NEET problems involve springs in oscillations or block-spring systems.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves a spring (\( k = 100 \, \text{N/m} \)) compressed by 0.2 m. Calculate the work done by the spring when released.
- **Solution**: \( W_s = -\frac{1}{2} k x^2 = -\frac{1}{2} \times 100 \times 0.2^2 = -\frac{1}{2} \times 100 \times 0.04 = -2 \, \text{J} \) (2 significant figures). The negative work reflects the spring’s restorative force, common in NEET spring problems.

## 7.4 Power

Power is the rate of doing work, defined as \( P = \frac{W}{t} \) or \( P = \vec{F} \cdot \vec{v} \), measured in watts (W, J/s = kg·m²/s³). JEE/NEET problems often involve calculating power in mechanical systems, like engines or objects moving against forces. *University Physics* notes applications in renewable energy systems, relevant for JEE Advanced.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves a 500 kg elevator moving upward at 2 m/s with a lifting force of 5500 N. Calculate the power delivered.
- **Solution**: \( P = \vec{F} \cdot \vec{v} = F v \cos\theta \). Since force and velocity are upward, \( \theta = 0^\circ \), \( P = 5500 \times 2 = 11000 \, \text{W} = 11 \, \text{kW} \) (2 significant figures). This is a typical JEE power question.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves a 50 kg person climbing 10 m in 20 s (\( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)). Calculate the average power.
- **Solution**: Work \( W = F_g h = m g h = 50 \times 9.8 \times 10 = 4900 \, \text{J} \). Power \( P = \frac{W}{t} = \frac{4900}{20} = 245 \, \text{W} \) (2 significant figures). This is a common NEET power problem in biomechanics.
