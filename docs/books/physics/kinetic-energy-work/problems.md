# Kinetic Energy and Work Problems

This section provides **100 problems** to test your understanding of kinetic energy and work concepts, including the work-energy theorem, kinetic energy, work done by gravitational and spring forces, and power. Inspired by JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs), these problems are tailored for exam preparation, offering a mix of numerical, conceptual, and derivation-based challenges. They are organized by difficulty and type to support progressive learning and build confidence for competitive exams.

## Problem Types
- **JEE Main PYQ-Style (35)**: Numerical, straightforward problems focusing on work calculations, kinetic energy changes, and power (e.g., work by forces, elevator power).
- **JEE Advanced PYQ-Style (30)**: Conceptual, multi-step problems requiring derivations or complex applications (e.g., work-energy theorem with multiple forces, spring systems).
- **NEET PYQ-Style (35)**: Practical, conceptual problems emphasizing real-world applications (e.g., work in biomechanics, power in climbing).

## Problems
Below are **10 sample problems** from the set of 100, covering the range of difficulty and types. The full set includes 40 numerical, 40 conceptual, and 20 derivation-based problems, ensuring comprehensive coverage of kinetic energy and work topics.
