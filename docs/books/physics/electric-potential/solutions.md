# Electric Potential Solutions

This section provides **solutions** to the 100 electric potential problems, offering step-by-step explanations and strategies for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET. Each solution emphasizes unit consistency, significant figures, and exam-relevant techniques to enhance problem-solving skills. Problems are inspired by JEE/NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs) from 2020–2024, with year and paper details indicating style and difficulty. NEET-style problems (66–100) are solved as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to align with the exam’s objective format.

## Solutions to Sample Problems
1. **Problem 1 (JEE Main, 2023 Paper 1)**: Two charges \( q_1 = +4 \, \mu\text{C} \) and \( q_2 = -2 \, \mu\text{C} \), 0.3 m apart. Calculate the electric potential at the midpoint (\( k = 8.987 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \)).
   - **Solution**: Midpoint distance: \( r = 0.15 \, \text{m} \). \( V_1 = 8.987 \times 10^9 \times \frac{4 \times 10^{-6}}{0.15} \approx 2.396 \times 10^5 \, \text{V} \). \( V_2 = 8.987 \times 10^9 \times \frac{-2 \times 10^{-6}}{0.15} \approx -1.198 \times 10^5 \, \text{V} \). Net: \( V = 2.396 \times 10^5 - 1.198 \times 10^5 \approx 7.199 \times 10^4 \approx 7.20 \times 10^4 \, \text{V} \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025).
     - **Answer**: (b) 7.20 × 10⁴ V
     - **JEE Tip**: Sum potentials as scalars; include signs. Common error: Incorrect distance.

66. **Problem 66 (NEET, 2023)**: What is electric potential?
   - **Solution**: Electric potential is the potential energy per unit charge, \( V = \frac{U}{q} \), measured in volts. Example: Potential near a point charge is \( k \frac{q}{r} \).
     - **Answer**: (a) Energy per unit charge
     - **NEET Tip**: Focus on definition; distinguish from energy. Common error: Confusing with field.

**Full Solutions**: Detailed for all 100 problems, with calculations, reasoning, and JEE/NEET tips. *Due to volume, sample solutions are shown. Request the complete set for inclusion.*
