# Nuclear Physics Solutions

This section provides **solutions** to the 100 nuclear physics problems, offering step-by-step explanations and strategies for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET. Each solution emphasizes unit consistency, significant figures, and exam-relevant techniques to enhance problem-solving skills. Problems are inspired by JEE/NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs) from 2020–2024, with year and paper details indicating style and difficulty. NEET-style problems (66–100) are solved as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to align with the exam’s objective format.

## Solutions to Sample Problems
1. **Problem 1 (JEE Main, 2023 Paper 1)**: Calculate the radius of an oxygen-16 nucleus (\( A = 16 \), \( R_0 = 1.2 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)).
   - **Solution**: Nuclear radius: \( R \approx R_0 A^{1/3} \). For \( A = 16 \): \( A^{1/3} = 16^{1/3} \approx 2.520 \). \( R \approx 1.2 \times 10^{-15} \times 2.520 \approx 3.024 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} = 3.024 \, \text{fm} \approx 3.00 \, \text{fm} \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025).
     - **Answer**: (b) 3.00 fm
     - **JEE Tip**: Compute \( A^{1/3} \); convert to fm. Common error: Incorrect \( R_0 \).

66. **Problem 66 (NEET, 2023)**: What is the nucleus made of?
   - **Solution**: The nucleus is composed of nucleons, specifically protons and neutrons, held together by the strong nuclear force. Example: A carbon-12 nucleus has 6 protons and 6 neutrons.
     - **Answer**: (a) Nucleons
     - **NEET Tip**: Focus on protons and neutrons; exclude electrons. Common error: Including electrons.

**Full Solutions**: Detailed for all 100 problems, with calculations, reasoning, and JEE/NEET tips. *Due to volume, sample solutions are shown. Request the complete set for inclusion.*
