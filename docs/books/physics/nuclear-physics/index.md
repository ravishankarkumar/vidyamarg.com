# Chapter 42: Nuclear Physics

Nuclear physics explores the nucleus, unlocking the secrets of radioactivity, nuclear energy, and medical applications like PET scans. This chapter covers nuclear structure and properties, radioactivity and decay processes, nuclear reactions and binding energy, and applications of nuclear physics. These concepts are critical for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET, appearing in problems on decay constants, binding energy, and reaction energy. With clear explanations, exam-focused examples, and robust problem-solving strategies, this chapter equips students to master nuclear physics in competitive exams, ensuring precision and conceptual clarity.

## 42.1 Nuclear Structure and Properties

The **nucleus** consists of protons and neutrons (nucleons), held by the strong nuclear force. Nuclear mass is given in atomic mass units (u), where 1 u ≈ 1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg. The nuclear radius is approximately \( R \approx R_0 A^{1/3} \), where \( R_0 \approx 1.2 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) and \( A \) is the mass number. JEE/NEET problems involve calculating nuclear size or mass. *Fundamentals of Physics* emphasizes nuclear density and stability.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves calculating the radius of a carbon-12 nucleus (\( A = 12 \), \( R_0 = 1.2 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)).
- **Solution**: Nuclear radius: \( R \approx R_0 A^{1/3} \). For \( A = 12 \): \( A^{1/3} \approx 12^{1/3} \approx 2.289 \). \( R \approx 1.2 \times 10^{-15} \times 2.289 \approx 2.747 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \approx 2.75 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \approx 2.75 \, \text{fm} \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025). This is a standard JEE nuclear structure problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Use \( A^{1/3} \); convert to femtometers (fm). Common error: Incorrect \( R_0 \).

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks the composition of the nucleus.
- **Solution**: The nucleus contains **protons and neutrons**, held by the strong nuclear force. Option (a) “Protons and neutrons” is correct. This is a typical NEET nuclear structure problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Nucleons are protons and neutrons; exclude electrons. Common error: Including electrons.

## 42.2 Radioactivity and Decay Processes

**Radioactivity** involves spontaneous nuclear decay: **alpha decay** (emitting \( ^4_2\text{He} \)), **beta decay** (emitting \( e^- \) or \( e^+ \)), and **gamma decay** (emitting photons). The decay rate follows \( N = N_0 e^{-\lambda t} \), where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant, and half-life is \( T_{1/2} = \frac{\ln 2}{\lambda} \approx \frac{0.693}{\lambda} \). JEE/NEET problems involve calculating half-life or remaining nuclei. *University Physics* connects decay to nuclear stability.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves a sample with a half-life of 2.0 days. Calculate the fraction remaining after 6.0 days.
- **Solution**: Half-life: \( T_{1/2} = 2.0 \, \text{days} \). Number of half-lives: \( \frac{t}{T_{1/2}} = \frac{6.0}{2.0} = 3 \). Fraction remaining: \( \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^n = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 = \frac{1}{8} = 0.125 \). Answer: **0.125** (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025). This is a classic JEE decay problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Use \( \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^n \); count half-lives. Common error: Incorrect time division.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks the type of particle emitted in beta-minus decay.
- **Solution**: Beta-minus decay emits an **electron** (\( e^- \)) and an antineutrino. Option (a) “Electron” is correct. This is a typical NEET decay problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Beta-minus emits \( e^- \); distinguish from alpha. Common error: Confusing with beta-plus.

## 42.3 Nuclear Reactions and Binding Energy

**Nuclear reactions** conserve mass number and charge, e.g., fission or fusion. **Binding energy** is the energy required to separate nucleons, given by \( E_b = \Delta m c^2 \), where \( \Delta m \) is the mass defect. For a nucleus, \( E_b = [Z m_p + (A - Z) m_n - m_{\text{nucleus}}] c^2 \). JEE/NEET problems involve calculating binding energy or reaction energy. *Fundamentals of Physics* emphasizes energy release in reactions.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves calculating the binding energy of helium-4 (\( ^4_2\text{He} \), atomic mass 4.002602 u, \( m_p = 1.007825 \, \text{u} \), \( m_n = 1.008665 \, \text{u} \), 1 u = 931.494 MeV/c²).
- **Solution**: Mass defect: \( \Delta m = [Z m_p + (A - Z) m_n - m_{\text{nucleus}}] \). For \( ^4_2\text{He} \): \( Z = 2 \), \( A = 4 \), \( \Delta m = [2 \times 1.007825 + 2 \times 1.008665 - 4.002602] = [2.015650 + 2.017330 - 4.002602] = 4.032980 - 4.002602 = 0.030378 \, \text{u} \). Binding energy: \( E_b = \Delta m \times 931.494 \approx 0.030378 \times 931.494 \approx 28.294 \, \text{MeV} \approx 28.3 \, \text{MeV} \). This is a standard JEE binding energy problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Sum proton and neutron masses; subtract nuclear mass. Common error: Using atomic mass without correction.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks the source of energy in nuclear fission.
- **Solution**: Fission energy comes from the **mass defect**, converted to energy via \( E = \Delta m c^2 \). Option (a) “Mass defect” is correct. This is a typical NEET reaction problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Fission splits nucleus; energy from binding difference. Common error: Confusing with fusion.

## 42.4 Applications of Nuclear Physics

**Applications** include nuclear power (fission reactors), medical imaging (PET scans), and carbon dating (using \( ^{14}\text{C} \)). Nuclear reactions power stars via fusion. JEE/NEET problems involve practical applications or decay-based calculations. *University Physics* connects nuclear physics to energy and medicine.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves carbon-14 dating with a half-life of 5730 years. A sample has 25% of its original \( ^{14}\text{C} \). Calculate its age.
- **Solution**: Fraction remaining: \( \frac{N}{N_0} = 0.25 = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^n \). Thus, \( \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^n = \frac{1}{4} \), \( n = 2 \). Age: \( t = n \times T_{1/2} = 2 \times 5730 = 11460 \, \text{years} \approx 11500 \, \text{years} \). This is a classic JEE application problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Solve for \( n \); multiply by half-life. Common error: Incorrect fraction interpretation.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks the use of nuclear physics in medicine.
- **Solution**: Nuclear physics is used in **medical imaging**, such as PET scans, using radioactive isotopes. Option (a) “Medical imaging” is correct. This is a typical NEET application problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Relate to isotopes; distinguish from X-rays. Common error: Confusing with radiation therapy.
