# Chapter 8: Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy

Potential energy and the conservation of energy provide a powerful approach to analyzing motion by tracking energy transformations, complementing the work-energy principles from Chapter 7. This chapter explores potential energy, the conservation of mechanical energy, work done by non-conservative forces, and potential energy curves with equilibrium. These concepts are crucial for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET, appearing in problems involving pendulums, springs, roller coasters, and incline systems. With clear explanations, exam-focused examples, and robust problem-solving strategies, this chapter equips students to master energy conservation problems in competitive exams, ensuring precision and conceptual clarity.

## 8.1 Potential Energy

### Gravitational Potential Energy
Potential energy is the energy stored in an object due to its position or configuration in a force field. Gravitational potential energy is given by \( U_g = m g h \), where \( m \) is mass (kg), \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) is gravitational acceleration, and \( h \) is height (m) relative to a reference point. Measured in joules (J, kg·m²/s²), it depends on the choice of reference (\( h = 0 \)). JEE/NEET problems often involve gravitational potential energy in vertical motion or inclines.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves a 3 kg object raised 5 m above the ground (\( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)). Calculate the gravitational potential energy.
- **Solution**: \( U_g = m g h = 3 \times 9.8 \times 5 = 147 \, \text{J} \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025). This is a standard JEE numerical question on potential energy.

### Spring Potential Energy
Spring potential energy, stored due to deformation, is \( U_s = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 \), where \( k \) is the spring constant (N/m) and \( x \) is the displacement from equilibrium (m). It is always positive and depends on the stretch or compression. NEET problems often involve springs in oscillatory systems or block-spring setups.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves a spring (\( k = 200 \, \text{N/m} \)) stretched by 0.1 m. Calculate the potential energy stored.
- **Solution**: \( U_s = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 200 \times 0.1^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 200 \times 0.01 = 1 \, \text{J} \) (2 significant figures). This is a common NEET spring energy question.

## 8.2 Conservation of Mechanical Energy

Mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic energy (\( K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \)) and potential energy (\( U = U_g + U_s \)). The conservation of mechanical energy states that, in the absence of non-conservative forces (e.g., friction, air resistance), total mechanical energy is constant: \( K_i + U_i = K_f + U_f \). JEE/NEET problems frequently use this principle for systems like pendulums, roller coasters, or frictionless inclines, simplifying motion analysis. *University Physics* highlights applications in amusement park rides, tested in advanced JEE questions.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves a 0.5 kg ball dropped from 10 m (\( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)), frictionless. Calculate the speed at 2 m above the ground.
- **Solution**: Initial energy: \( U_i = m g h_i = 0.5 \times 9.8 \times 10 = 49 \, \text{J} \), \( K_i = 0 \). Final energy: \( U_f = m g h_f = 0.5 \times 9.8 \times 2 = 9.8 \, \text{J} \). By conservation, \( K_i + U_i = K_f + U_f \): \( 0 + 49 = K_f + 9.8 \). \( K_f = 39.2 \, \text{J} \). \( K_f = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \): \( 39.2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.5 \times v^2 \), \( v^2 = \frac{39.2}{0.25} = 156.8 \), \( v \approx 12.52 \, \text{m/s} \approx 12.5 \, \text{m/s} \) (3 significant figures). This is a classic JEE energy conservation problem.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves a 1 kg mass on a spring (\( k = 100 \, \text{N/m} \)) compressed 0.2 m, released frictionlessly. Calculate the maximum speed.
- **Solution**: Initial energy: \( U_s = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 \times 0.2^2 = 2 \, \text{J} \), \( K_i = 0 \). At maximum speed, \( U_s = 0 \), so \( K_f = U_i = 2 \, \text{J} \). \( K_f = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \): \( 2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times v^2 \), \( v^2 = 4 \), \( v = 2 \, \text{m/s} \) (2 significant figures). This is a typical NEET spring problem.

## 8.3 Work Done by Non-Conservative Forces

Non-conservative forces, like friction or air resistance, dissipate mechanical energy into other forms (e.g., heat). The work done by non-conservative forces equals the change in mechanical energy: \( W_{\text{nc}} = (K_f + U_f) - (K_i + U_i) \). JEE/NEET problems often involve calculating work done by friction or the resulting energy loss in systems with dissipation.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves a 2 kg block sliding 5 m down a rough incline (30°, \( \mu_k = 0.2 \), \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)). Calculate the work done by friction.
- **Solution**: Height \( h = 5 \sin 30^\circ = 2.5 \, \text{m} \). Initial energy: \( U_i = m g h = 2 \times 9.8 \times 2.5 = 49 \, \text{J} \), \( K_i = 0 \). Final energy: \( U_f = 0 \). Normal force \( N = m g \cos 30^\circ = 2 \times 9.8 \times 0.866 \approx 17.0 \, \text{N} \). Friction force \( f_k = \mu_k N = 0.2 \times 17.0 = 3.4 \, \text{N} \). Work by friction \( W_{\text{nc}} = -f_k d = -3.4 \times 5 = -17 \, \text{J} \). Verify: Final speed via \( v^2 = u^2 + 2 a s \), where \( a = \frac{m g \sin 30^\circ - f_k}{m} = \frac{9.8 - 3.4}{2} = 3.2 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), \( v^2 = 2 \times 3.2 \times 5 = 32 \), \( K_f = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 32 = 32 \, \text{J} \). \( W_{\text{nc}} = (K_f + U_f) - (K_i + U_i) = (32 + 0) - (0 + 49) = -17 \, \text{J} \) (2 significant figures). This confirms the calculation, a common JEE problem.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves a 0.5 kg block pushed 2 m with 10 N against 3 N friction. Calculate the work done by friction.
- **Solution**: \( W_{\text{nc}} = -f_k d = -3 \times 2 = -6 \, \text{J} \) (2 significant figures). This straightforward friction work calculation is typical in NEET.

## 8.4 Potential Energy Curves and Equilibrium

Potential energy curves plot \( U \) versus position, revealing stable, unstable, or neutral equilibrium:
- **Stable**: At minima (\( \frac{dU}{dx} = 0 \), \( \frac{d^2U}{dx^2} > 0 \)), small displacements return the system.
- **Unstable**: At maxima (\( \frac{dU}{dx} = 0 \), \( \frac{d^2U}{dx^2} < 0 \)), small displacements amplify.
- **Neutral**: At constant \( U \) regions (\( \frac{dU}{dx} = 0 \), \( \frac{d^2U}{dx^2} = 0 \)).

The force is \( \vec{F} = -\frac{dU}{dx} \hat{i} \). JEE Advanced problems often involve analyzing equilibrium or motion using potential energy curves, such as for springs or gravitational systems. *University Physics* notes applications in molecular dynamics, tested in advanced JEE.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves a potential energy function \( U(x) = 2x^2 - 4x \, \text{J} \). Find the equilibrium position and its type.
- **Solution**: Equilibrium at \( \frac{dU}{dx} = 0 \). \( U(x) = 2x^2 - 4x \), so \( \frac{dU}{dx} = 4x - 4 = 0 \), \( x = 1 \, \text{m} \). Second derivative \( \frac{d^2U}{dx^2} = 4 > 0 \), indicating a minimum (stable equilibrium). This is a typical JEE Advanced question on potential curves.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves a spring system with \( U_s = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 \), \( k = 50 \, \text{N/m} \). Calculate the force at \( x = 0.3 \, \text{m} \).
- **Solution**: Force \( F = -\frac{dU}{dx} \). \( U_s = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 \), so \( \frac{dU}{dx} = k x = 50 \times 0.3 = 15 \, \text{N} \). \( F = -15 \, \text{N} \) (restorative, toward equilibrium, 2 significant figures). This is a common NEET spring force question.
