# Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy Problems

This section provides **100 problems** to test your understanding of potential energy and conservation of energy concepts, including gravitational and spring potential energy, conservation of mechanical energy, work by non-conservative forces, and potential energy curves with equilibrium. Inspired by JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs), these problems are tailored for exam preparation, offering a mix of numerical, conceptual, and derivation-based challenges. They are organized by difficulty and type to support progressive learning and build confidence for competitive exams.

## Problem Types
- **JEE Main PYQ-Style (35)**: Numerical, straightforward problems focusing on potential energy calculations and energy conservation (e.g., pendulum speed, spring energy).
- **JEE Advanced PYQ-Style (30)**: Conceptual, multi-step problems requiring derivations or complex applications (e.g., potential energy curves, non-conservative work).
- **NEET PYQ-Style (35)**: Practical, conceptual problems emphasizing real-world applications (e.g., roller coaster energy, biomechanics).

## Problems
Below are **10 sample problems** from the set of 100, covering the range of difficulty and types. The full set includes 40 numerical, 40 conceptual, and 20 derivation-based problems, ensuring comprehensive coverage of potential energy and conservation topics.
