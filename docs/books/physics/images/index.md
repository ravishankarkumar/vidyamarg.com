# Chapter 34: Images

Image formation by mirrors and lenses is fundamental to understanding optical systems, from eyeglasses to telescopes. This chapter explores reflection and plane mirrors, spherical mirrors and image formation, thin lenses and the lens formula, and optical instruments and magnification. These concepts are critical for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET, appearing in problems on ray diagrams, image characteristics, and optical devices. With clear explanations, exam-focused examples, and robust problem-solving strategies, this chapter equips students to master image formation in competitive exams, ensuring precision and conceptual clarity.

## 34.1 Reflection and Plane Mirrors

**Reflection** follows the law of reflection: the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection (\( \theta_i = \theta_r \)). **Plane mirrors** form virtual, upright images at the same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front, with lateral inversion. JEE/NEET problems involve calculating image position or characteristics. *Fundamentals of Physics* emphasizes ray tracing for plane mirrors.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves an object 2 m in front of a plane mirror. Calculate the distance between the object and its image.
- **Solution**: In a plane mirror, the image is formed at the same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front. Given object distance \( d = 2 \, \text{m} \), image distance is 2 m behind the mirror. Total distance: \( 2 + 2 = 4 \, \text{m} \). This is a standard JEE plane mirror problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Double the object distance; image is virtual. Common error: Forgetting to sum distances.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks the nature of the image formed by a plane mirror.
- **Solution**: A plane mirror forms a **virtual, upright, same-sized** image. Option (a) “Virtual and upright” is correct. This is a typical NEET reflection problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Plane mirror images are always virtual; check orientation. Common error: Assuming real image.

## 34.2 Spherical Mirrors and Image Formation

**Spherical mirrors** (concave and convex) form images based on the mirror formula: \( \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v} \), where \( f \) is focal length, \( u \) is object distance, and \( v \) is image distance. **Magnification**: \( m = -\frac{v}{u} \). Sign convention: real images have positive \( v \), virtual images negative. JEE/NEET problems involve calculating image position or magnification. *University Physics* highlights ray diagrams for spherical mirrors.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves a concave mirror with focal length 20 cm and an object 30 cm in front. Calculate the image distance.
- **Solution**: Mirror formula: \( \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v} \). Given \( f = 20 \, \text{cm} \), \( u = 30 \, \text{cm} \): \( \frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{20} - \frac{1}{30} = \frac{3 - 2}{60} = \frac{1}{60} \). Thus, \( v = 60 \, \text{cm} \). Image is real, 60 cm in front (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025). This is a classic JEE mirror problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Apply sign convention; positive \( v \) for real images. Common error: Incorrect signs.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks the nature of the image formed by a convex mirror.
- **Solution**: A convex mirror always forms a **virtual, upright, diminished** image. Option (a) “Virtual and diminished” is correct. This is a typical NEET spherical mirror problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Convex mirrors produce virtual images; check size. Common error: Assuming real image.

## 34.3 Thin Lenses and Lens Formula

**Thin lenses** (convex and concave) form images using the lens formula: \( \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v} \), with magnification \( m = \frac{v}{u} \). Sign convention: for convex lenses, \( f \) is positive, \( v \) is positive for real images; for concave, \( f \) is negative. JEE/NEET problems involve calculating image position or magnification. *Fundamentals of Physics* emphasizes lens ray diagrams.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves a convex lens with focal length 15 cm and an object 20 cm in front. Calculate the image distance.
- **Solution**: Lens formula: \( \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v} \). Given \( f = 15 \, \text{cm} \), \( u = 20 \, \text{cm} \): \( \frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{15} - \frac{1}{20} = \frac{4 - 3}{60} = \frac{1}{60} \). Thus, \( v = 60 \, \text{cm} \). Image is real, 60 cm on the opposite side. This is a standard JEE lens problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Use positive \( f \) for convex lenses; check signs. Common error: Forgetting sign convention.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks the nature of the image formed by a concave lens.
- **Solution**: A concave lens forms a **virtual, upright, diminished** image. Option (a) “Virtual and diminished” is correct. This is a typical NEET lens problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Concave lenses always produce virtual images; check size. Common error: Assuming real image.

## 34.4 Optical Instruments and Magnification

**Optical instruments** like microscopes and telescopes use lenses to magnify images. **Magnification** depends on lens combinations: for a microscope, \( m = m_o \times m_e \); for a telescope, \( m = -\frac{f_o}{f_e} \). JEE/NEET problems involve calculating magnification or image characteristics. *University Physics* connects instruments to practical applications like biology and astronomy.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves a telescope with objective focal length 100 cm and eyepiece focal length 5 cm. Calculate the angular magnification.
- **Solution**: Telescope magnification: \( m = -\frac{f_o}{f_e} \). Given \( f_o = 100 \, \text{cm} \), \( f_e = 5 \, \text{cm} \): \( m = -\frac{100}{5} = -20 \). Magnitude: \( |m| = 20 \). This is a classic JEE telescope problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Use focal length ratio; ignore negative sign for magnitude. Common error: Incorrect lens identification.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks the purpose of the objective lens in a microscope.
- **Solution**: The objective lens **forms a real, magnified image** that the eyepiece further magnifies. Option (a) “Forms real image” is correct. This is a typical NEET instrument problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Objective forms primary image; eyepiece magnifies. Common error: Confusing lens roles.

## Review & Summary
