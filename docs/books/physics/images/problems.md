# Images Problems

This section provides **100 problems** to test your understanding of image formation, including plane mirrors, spherical mirrors, thin lenses, and optical instruments. Inspired by JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs) from 2020–2024, these problems are tailored for exam preparation, offering a mix of numerical, conceptual, and derivation-based challenges. Each problem includes the year and paper of inspiration (e.g., JEE Main 2023 Paper 1) to reflect its alignment with exam patterns. NEET-style problems (66–100) are formatted as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to match the exam’s objective format. Problems are organized by difficulty and type to support progressive learning and build confidence.

## Problem Types
- **JEE Main PYQ-Style (35 Numerical)**: Straightforward MCQs on image distance, magnification, and focal length, inspired by JEE Main papers (2020–2024, Paper 1 or 2).
- **JEE Advanced PYQ-Style (30 Problems: 15 Conceptual, 15 Derivation)**: Multi-step problems requiring deep understanding or derivations, inspired by JEE Advanced papers (2020–2024, Paper 1 or 2).
- **NEET PYQ-Style (35 Problems: 30 Conceptual, 5 Numerical)**: MCQs emphasizing real-world applications (e.g., image nature, optical instruments), inspired by NEET papers (2020–2024).
