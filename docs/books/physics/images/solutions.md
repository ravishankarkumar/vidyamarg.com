# Images Solutions

This section provides **solutions** to the 100 image formation problems, offering step-by-step explanations and strategies for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET. Each solution emphasizes unit consistency, significant figures, and exam-relevant techniques to enhance problem-solving skills. Problems are inspired by JEE/NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs) from 2020–2024, with year and paper details indicating style and difficulty. NEET-style problems (66–100) are solved as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to align with the exam’s objective format.

## Solutions to Sample Problems
1. **Problem 1 (JEE Main, 2023 Paper 1)**: An object is 3 m in front of a plane mirror. Calculate the distance between the object and its image.
   - **Solution**: In a plane mirror, the image is formed at the same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front. Given object distance \( d = 3 \, \text{m} \), image distance is 3 m behind the mirror. Total distance: \( 3 + 3 = 6 \, \text{m} \approx 6.0 \, \text{m} \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025).
     - **Answer**: (b) 6.0 m
     - **JEE Tip**: Double the object distance; image is virtual. Common error: Using mirror formula incorrectly.

66. **Problem 66 (NEET, 2023)**: What is the law of reflection?
   - **Solution**: The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection (\( \theta_i = \theta_r \)) for light reflecting off a surface. Example: A ray hitting a mirror at 30° reflects at 30°.
     - **Answer**: (a) Equal angles
     - **NEET Tip**: Law applies to all mirrors; angles are equal. Common error: Confusing with refraction.

**Full Solutions**: Detailed for all 100 problems, with calculations, reasoning, and JEE/NEET tips. *Due to volume, sample solutions are shown. Request the complete set for inclusion.*
