# Chapter 5: Force and Motion—I

Forces are interactions that influence an object’s motion, and Newton’s laws of motion provide the framework to understand these effects. This chapter explores forces, Newton’s first, second, and third laws, and their applications in analyzing motion. These principles are fundamental for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET, appearing in problems involving objects under forces, such as blocks on inclines, pulley systems, and collisions. With clear explanations, exam-focused examples, and robust problem-solving strategies, this chapter equips students to master force and motion concepts in competitive exams, ensuring precision and conceptual clarity.

## 5.1 Forces and Newton’s First Law

### Forces
A force is a vector quantity that can cause an object to accelerate, decelerate, or change direction, measured in newtons (N, kg·m/s²). Common forces include gravitational force (\( \vec{F}_g = m \vec{g} \)), normal force, friction, and tension. JEE/NEET problems often involve identifying and summing forces acting on an object.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves a 2 kg box resting on a table. Identify the forces acting on it.
- **Solution**: The forces are gravitational force (\( \vec{F}_g = m \vec{g} = 2 \times 9.8 = 19.6 \, \text{N} \) downward) and normal force (\( \vec{N} \), upward, balancing gravity). Since the box is at rest, no net force acts. This is a common NEET conceptual question.

### Newton’s First Law
Newton’s first law states that an object remains at rest or in uniform motion (constant velocity) unless acted upon by a net external force (\( \sum \vec{F} = 0 \)). This law defines an **inertial reference frame**, where objects maintain their state of motion. JEE/NEET problems use this law to analyze equilibrium scenarios, such as objects at rest or moving with constant velocity.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves a 5 kg block at rest on a horizontal surface with no friction. Calculate the net force.
- **Solution**: Since the block is at rest, Newton’s first law implies \( \sum \vec{F} = 0 \). Gravitational force (\( 5 \times 9.8 = 49 \, \text{N} \) down) is balanced by the normal force (49 N up). Net force = 0 N. This equilibrium analysis is typical in JEE problems.

## 5.2 Newton’s Second Law

Newton’s second law relates force, mass, and acceleration: \( \sum \vec{F} = m \vec{a} \), where \( \sum \vec{F} \) is the net force (N), \( m \) is mass (kg), and \( \vec{a} \) is acceleration (m/s²). The law is vector-based, so components are analyzed separately (e.g., \( \sum F_x = m a_x \)). JEE/NEET problems frequently involve calculating acceleration or forces in dynamic systems, such as blocks or pulleys. *University Physics* highlights applications in modern engineering, like vehicle dynamics, tested in advanced JEE questions.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves a 3 kg block pushed with a 15 N force horizontally on a frictionless surface. Calculate the acceleration.
- **Solution**: \( \sum \vec{F} = m \vec{a} \). Net force = 15 N (no friction). Thus, \( a = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (2 significant figures, April 14, 2025). This is a standard JEE numerical question.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves a 4 kg object with forces \( \vec{F}_1 = 10 \hat{i} \, \text{N} \), \( \vec{F}_2 = -6 \hat{i} + 8 \hat{j} \, \text{N} \). Calculate the acceleration.
- **Solution**: Net force \( \sum \vec{F} = \vec{F}_1 + \vec{F}_2 = (10 - 6) \hat{i} + 8 \hat{j} = 4 \hat{i} + 8 \hat{j} \, \text{N} \). \( \vec{a} = \frac{\sum \vec{F}}{m} = \frac{4 \hat{i} + 8 \hat{j}}{4} = \hat{i} + 2 \hat{j} \, \text{m/s}^2 \). Magnitude \( a = \sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} \approx 2.24 \, \text{m/s}^2 \approx 2.2 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (2 significant figures). This vector problem is typical in NEET.

## 5.3 Newton’s Third Law

Newton’s third law states that for every action force, there is an equal and opposite reaction force: \( \vec{F}_{A \text{ on } B} = -\vec{F}_{B \text{ on } A} \). These forces act on different objects, so they don’t cancel. JEE/NEET problems use this law to analyze interactions, such as tension in ropes or normal forces between objects.

**Solved Example**: A JEE problem involves a 10 kg block resting on a table. What is the force exerted by the table on the block?
- **Solution**: Gravitational force on the block (\( 10 \times 9.8 = 98 \, \text{N} \) downward) is the action force. By Newton’s third law, the table exerts an equal and opposite normal force, 98 N upward. This is a common JEE conceptual question.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves two blocks (5 kg and 3 kg) in contact on a frictionless surface, pushed with 16 N. Calculate the force between the blocks.
- **Solution**: System acceleration: \( a = \frac{F}{m_{\text{total}}} = \frac{16}{5 + 3} = 2 \, \text{m/s}^2 \). For the 3 kg block, net force = \( m a = 3 \times 2 = 6 \, \text{N} \), provided by the contact force from the 5 kg block. By Newton’s third law, the 3 kg block exerts 6 N back on the 5 kg block. **Answer**: 6 N.

## 5.4 Applying Newton’s Laws

Applying Newton’s laws involves drawing **free-body diagrams** (FBDs) to identify forces, summing forces in each direction (\( \sum F_x = m a_x \), \( \sum F_y = m a_y \)), and solving for unknowns (e.g., acceleration, tension). JEE/NEET problems often involve systems like blocks on inclines, pulleys, or multi-object interactions. Steps include:
1. Draw FBDs for each object.
2. Apply \( \sum \vec{F} = m \vec{a} \) in component form.
3. Solve simultaneous equations for unknowns.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves a 5 kg block on a 30° frictionless incline (\( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)). Calculate the acceleration down the incline.
- **Solution**: FBD: Gravitational force \( \vec{F}_g = 5 \times 9.8 = 49 \, \text{N} \), with component down incline \( F_{\parallel} = F_g \sin 30^\circ = 49 \times 0.5 = 24.5 \, \text{N} \). Normal force balances the perpendicular component. Net force = 24.5 N down incline. \( a = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{24.5}{5} = 4.9 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (2 significant figures). This incline problem is a JEE staple.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves a 2 kg block pulled by a 10 N force at 37° to the horizontal on a frictionless surface. Calculate the acceleration.
- **Solution**: FBD: Horizontal force \( F_x = F \cos\theta = 10 \cos 37^\circ \approx 10 \times 0.8 = 8 \, \text{N} \). Vertical forces (normal, gravity) balance (\( \sum F_y = 0 \)). Net force = 8 N horizontal. \( a = \frac{F_x}{m} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (2 significant figures). This is a common NEET force resolution problem.
