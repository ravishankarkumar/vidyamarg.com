# Force and Motion—I Problems

This section provides **100 problems** to test your understanding of force and motion concepts, including forces, Newton’s first, second, and third laws, and their applications in equilibrium and dynamic systems. Inspired by JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs), these problems are tailored for exam preparation, offering a mix of numerical, conceptual, and derivation-based challenges. They are organized by difficulty and type to support progressive learning and build confidence for competitive exams.

## Problem Types
- **JEE Main PYQ-Style (35)**: Numerical, straightforward problems focusing on Newton’s second law and equilibrium (e.g., acceleration of blocks, tension in ropes).
- **JEE Advanced PYQ-Style (30)**: Conceptual, multi-step problems requiring free-body diagrams and derivations (e.g., multi-object systems, incline motion).
- **NEET PYQ-Style (35)**: Practical, conceptual problems emphasizing real-world applications (e.g., normal forces in biomechanics, action-reaction pairs).

## Problems
Below are **10 sample problems** from the set of 100, covering the range of difficulty and types. The full set includes 40 numerical, 40 conceptual, and 20 derivation-based problems, ensuring comprehensive coverage of force and motion topics.

1. **JEE Main**: A 4 kg block is pushed with a 20 N force horizontally on a frictionless surface. Calculate the acceleration.
   - Options: (a) 4 m/s² (b) 5 m/s² (c) 6 m/s² (d) 8 m/s²
2. **NEET**: A 10 kg box rests on a table. Calculate the normal force exerted by the table (\( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)).
   - Options: (a) 49 N (b) 98 N (c) 147 N (d) 196 N
3. **JEE Advanced**: Derive the relationship \( \sum \vec{F} = m \vec{a} \) for a system of particles.
4. **NEET**: Two blocks (2 kg and 3 kg) are in contact on a frictionless surface, pushed with 15 N. Calculate the contact force between them.
5. **JEE Main**: A 6 kg block on a 30° frictionless incline (\( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)). Calculate the acceleration down the incline.
   - Options: (a) 4.9 m/s² (b) 5.6 m/s² (c) 6.3 m/s² (d) 7.0 m/s²
6. **JEE Advanced**: A 5 kg block is pulled by a 12 N force at 37° to the horizontal on a frictionless surface. Calculate the acceleration’s magnitude.
7. **NEET**: A 3 kg object experiences forces \( \vec{F}_1 = 8 \hat{i} \, \text{N} \), \( \vec{F}_2 = -4 \hat{i} + 6 \hat{j} \, \text{N} \). Calculate the acceleration’s magnitude.
8. **JEE Main**: A 2 kg block hangs from a rope. Calculate the tension if the block is at rest (\( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)).
   - Options: (a) 9.8 N (b) 19.6 N (c) 29.4 N (d) 39.2 N
9. **JEE Advanced**: Two masses (4 kg and 6 kg) connected by a rope over a frictionless pulley. Calculate the acceleration of the system (\( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)).
10. **NEET**: A 5 kg block is pushed with 25 N horizontally. If it accelerates at 3 m/s², calculate the frictional force.

**Full Problem Set**: The complete set of 100 problems includes:
- **Numerical (40)**: Calculations of acceleration, tension, normal forces (e.g., inclines, pulleys).
- **Conceptual (40)**: Questions on equilibrium, action-reaction pairs, and force identification.
- **Derivations (20)**: Deriving Newton’s laws or analyzing multi-object systems.
