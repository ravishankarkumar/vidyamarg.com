# Relativity Solutions

This section provides **solutions** to the 100 special relativity problems, offering step-by-step explanations and strategies for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET. Each solution emphasizes unit consistency, significant figures, and exam-relevant techniques to enhance problem-solving skills. Problems are inspired by JEE/NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs) from 2020–2024, with year and paper details indicating style and difficulty. NEET-style problems (66–100) are solved as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to align with the exam’s objective format.

## Solutions to Sample Problems
1. **Problem 1 (JEE Main, 2023 Paper 1)**: A spaceship moves at 0.5c relative to Earth. A process takes 20 s in its rest frame. Calculate the time observed on Earth (\( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)).
   - **Solution**: Time dilation: \( \Delta t = \frac{\Delta t_0}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Given \( \Delta t_0 = 20 \, \text{s} \), \( v = 0.5c \): \( \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 0.25 \), \( \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} \approx 0.866 \). Thus, \( \Delta t = \frac{20}{0.866} \approx 23.09 \, \text{s} \approx 23.1 \, \text{s} \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025).
     - **Answer**: (c) 23.1 s
     - **JEE Tip**: Use proper time; compute \( \gamma \). Common error: Using classical time.

66. **Problem 66 (NEET, 2023)**: What is special relativity’s first postulate?
   - **Solution**: The first postulate states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames, ensuring universal consistency. Example: Newton’s laws apply equally in a stationary lab or moving train.
     - **Answer**: (a) Same laws
     - **NEET Tip**: Focus on inertial frames; distinguish from light speed postulate. Common error: Confusing with second postulate.

**Full Solutions**: Detailed for all 100 problems, with calculations, reasoning, and JEE/NEET tips. *Due to volume, sample solutions are shown. Request the complete set for inclusion.*
