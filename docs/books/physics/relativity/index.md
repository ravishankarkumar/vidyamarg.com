# Chapter 37: Relativity

Special relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, revolutionizes our understanding of space, time, and energy at high speeds, underpinning modern physics and technologies like GPS and particle accelerators. This chapter explores the postulates of special relativity, time dilation and length contraction, relativistic velocity addition and momentum, and mass-energy equivalence. These concepts are critical for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET, appearing in problems on relativistic effects, energy calculations, and kinematics. With clear explanations, exam-focused examples, and robust problem-solving strategies, this chapter equips students to master relativity in competitive exams, ensuring precision and conceptual clarity.

## 37.1 Postulates of Special Relativity

**Special relativity** is based on two postulates: (1) the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames, and (2) the speed of light in a vacuum (\( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)) is constant for all observers. These lead to counterintuitive effects like time dilation and length contraction. JEE/NEET problems involve applying these postulates to relativistic scenarios. *Fundamentals of Physics* emphasizes the universality of physical laws.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves a spaceship moving at 0.6c relative to Earth. If a light signal is emitted from the spaceship, what is its speed as observed from Earth?
- **Solution**: According to the second postulate, the speed of light is constant at \( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) for all observers, regardless of the source’s motion. Thus, the observed speed is \( 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025). This is a standard JEE relativity problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Light speed is always \( c \); no relative motion affects it. Common error: Adding spaceship’s velocity.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks the key idea of special relativity’s first postulate.
- **Solution**: The first postulate states that the **laws of physics are the same** in all inertial frames. Option (a) “Universal physical laws” is correct. This is a typical NEET postulate problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: First postulate ensures consistency; focus on inertial frames. Common error: Confusing with light speed constancy.

## 37.2 Time Dilation and Length Contraction

**Time dilation**: A clock in a moving frame ticks slower, given by \( \Delta t = \frac{\Delta t_0}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), where \( \Delta t_0 \) is the proper time. **Length contraction**: An object’s length in the direction of motion shrinks, given by \( L = L_0 \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} \), where \( L_0 \) is the proper length. JEE/NEET problems involve calculating dilated times or contracted lengths. *University Physics* connects these to real-world applications like muon decay.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves a spaceship moving at 0.8c. A process in the spaceship takes 10 s in its rest frame. Calculate the time observed on Earth.
- **Solution**: Time dilation: \( \Delta t = \frac{\Delta t_0}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Given \( \Delta t_0 = 10 \, \text{s} \), \( v = 0.8c \): \( \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 0.64 \), \( \sqrt{1 - 0.64} = \sqrt{0.36} = 0.6 \). Thus, \( \Delta t = \frac{10}{0.6} \approx 16.67 \, \text{s} \approx 16.7 \, \text{s} \). This is a classic JEE time dilation problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Use proper time; compute \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Common error: Incorrect velocity squared.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks the effect of length contraction.
- **Solution**: Length contraction **shortens an object** in the direction of motion as observed by a stationary observer. Option (a) “Shortens length” is correct. This is a typical NEET length contraction problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Contraction occurs along motion; proper length is maximum. Common error: Assuming time-related effect.

## 37.3 Relativistic Velocity Addition and Momentum

**Relativistic velocity addition**: For an object moving at speed \( u \) in a frame moving at \( v \) relative to another frame, the observed velocity is \( w = \frac{u + v}{1 + uv/c^2} \). **Relativistic momentum**: \( p = \gamma m_0 v \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), \( m_0 \) is rest mass. JEE/NEET problems involve calculating combined velocities or momentum. *Fundamentals of Physics* highlights velocity addition’s departure from classical physics.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves a spaceship moving at 0.6c relative to Earth, firing a missile at 0.5c relative to the spaceship in the same direction. Calculate the missile’s speed relative to Earth.
- **Solution**: Velocity addition: \( w = \frac{u + v}{1 + uv/c^2} \). Given \( v = 0.6c \), \( u = 0.5c \): \( uv/c^2 = 0.6 \times 0.5 = 0.3 \), \( w = \frac{0.6c + 0.5c}{1 + 0.3} = \frac{1.1c}{1.3} \approx 0.846c \approx 2.54 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). This is a standard JEE velocity addition problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Normalize velocities with \( c \); compute denominator. Common error: Using classical addition.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks the definition of relativistic momentum.
- **Solution**: Relativistic momentum is **\( p = \gamma m_0 v \)**, where \( \gamma \) accounts for high speeds. Option (a) “\( \gamma m_0 v \)” is correct. This is a typical NEET momentum problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Momentum increases with speed; distinguish from classical. Common error: Using \( p = m_0 v \).

## 37.4 Mass-Energy Equivalence

**Mass-energy equivalence**, given by \( E = mc^2 \), where \( m = \gamma m_0 \), relates rest energy (\( E_0 = m_0 c^2 \)) and total energy (\( E = \gamma m_0 c^2 \)). Kinetic energy is \( K = (\gamma - 1) m_0 c^2 \). JEE/NEET problems involve calculating energies or mass changes. *University Physics* connects this to nuclear reactions and particle physics.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves a particle with rest mass 1.67 × 10⁻²⁷ kg moving at 0.9c. Calculate its total energy.
- **Solution**: Total energy: \( E = \gamma m_0 c^2 \). Given \( m_0 = 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \), \( v = 0.9c \), \( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \): \( \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 0.81 \), \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.81}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.19}} \approx 2.294 \). \( c^2 = 9 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2 \), \( E = 2.294 \times 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \times 9 \times 10^{16} \approx 3.45 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{J} \approx 3.45 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{J} \). This is a classic JEE energy problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Compute \( \gamma \); ensure unit consistency. Common error: Using rest energy only.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks the significance of \( E = mc^2 \).
- **Solution**: \( E = mc^2 \) represents **mass-energy equivalence**, showing mass can convert to energy. Option (a) “Mass-energy equivalence” is correct. This is a typical NEET energy problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Relates to nuclear energy; focus on equivalence. Common error: Confusing with kinetic energy.
