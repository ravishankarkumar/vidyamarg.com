# Chapter 3: Vectors

Vectors are essential tools in physics, describing quantities with both magnitude and direction, such as displacement, velocity, and force. This chapter introduces the fundamentals of vectors, including scalars, vector addition and subtraction, components, unit vectors, and scalar and vector products. These concepts are critical for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET, underpinning problems in mechanics (e.g., projectile motion), electromagnetism (e.g., electric fields), and dynamics (e.g., force resolution). With clear explanations, exam-focused examples, and rigorous problem-solving strategies, this chapter equips students to master vector-based questions in competitive exams, ensuring precision and conceptual clarity.

## 3.1 Scalars and Vectors

### Scalars
Scalars are quantities with magnitude but no direction, such as mass, time, and temperature. For example, a mass of 5 kg or a time of 10 seconds is fully described by a number and unit. Scalars are manipulated using standard arithmetic, a concept tested in JEE/NEET for distinguishing them from vectors.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves a car with a mass of 1200 kg and a journey time of 300 s. Are these scalars or vectors?
- **Solution**: Mass (1200 kg) and time (300 s) are scalars, as they have magnitude but no direction. This distinction is key in NEET conceptual questions.

### Vectors
Vectors have both magnitude and direction, such as displacement (e.g., 10 m east) or velocity (e.g., 20 m/s north). Represented by arrows (length for magnitude, arrowhead for direction), vectors are denoted as \( \vec{A} \) or in bold (**A**). JEE/NEET problems often require vector operations, like adding displacements or resolving forces.

**Solved Example**: A JEE problem describes a displacement of 15 m at 30° north of east. Is this a scalar or vector?
- **Solution**: Displacement (15 m, 30° north of east) is a vector, as it has magnitude (15 m) and direction (30°). This is a typical JEE kinematics question, setting the stage for vector addition.

## 3.2 Vector Addition and Subtraction

### Vector Addition
Vectors are added geometrically using the **head-to-tail method** or **parallelogram method**, producing a resultant vector. For two vectors \( \vec{A} \) and \( \vec{B} \), the resultant \( \vec{R} = \vec{A} + \vec{B} \). The magnitude and direction of \( \vec{R} \) depend on the angle between the vectors, often calculated using the cosine rule for non-perpendicular vectors. JEE/NEET problems frequently involve adding displacements or velocities.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves a boat moving 4 m/s east and a river current of 3 m/s north. Calculate the resultant velocity’s magnitude.
- **Solution**: Vectors are perpendicular (90°). Magnitude of resultant \( R = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} = \sqrt{4^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{16 + 9} = 5 \, \text{m/s} \) (2 significant figures, April 14, 2025). This is a classic JEE relative motion problem.

### Vector Subtraction
Vector subtraction is performed by adding the negative of a vector: \( \vec{A} - \vec{B} = \vec{A} + (-\vec{B}) \), where \( -\vec{B} \) has the same magnitude but opposite direction. Geometrically, this uses the head-to-tail method with the reversed vector. JEE/NEET problems may require subtracting velocities (e.g., relative motion).

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves a particle moving 10 m east (\( \vec{A} \)) then 6 m west (\( \vec{B} \)). Calculate the displacement.
- **Solution**: \( \vec{B} \) is west, so \( -\vec{B} \) is 6 m east. Resultant = \( \vec{A} + (-\vec{B}) = 10 \, \text{m east} - 6 \, \text{m west} = 4 \, \text{m east} \). This vector subtraction is common in NEET displacement questions.

## 3.3 Components of a Vector

A vector can be resolved into perpendicular components, typically along x- and y-axes: \( \vec{A} = A_x \hat{i} + A_y \hat{j} \), where \( A_x = A \cos\theta \), \( A_y = A \sin\theta \), and \( \theta \) is the angle with the x-axis. The magnitude is \( A = \sqrt{A_x^2 + A_y^2} \). Component resolution simplifies vector addition and is heavily tested in JEE/NEET for forces, velocities, and projectile motion. *University Physics* emphasizes components in real-world applications, like GPS vector analysis.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves a force of 20 N at 60° to the x-axis. Calculate the x- and y-components.
- **Solution**: \( A_x = A \cos\theta = 20 \cos 60^\circ = 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \, \text{N} \). \( A_y = A \sin\theta = 20 \sin 60^\circ = 20 \times 0.866 = 17.32 \, \text{N} \approx 17.3 \, \text{N} \) (3 significant figures). This resolution is a staple in JEE force problems.

## 3.4 Unit Vectors

Unit vectors (\( \hat{i} \), \( \hat{j} \), \( \hat{k} \)) have a magnitude of 1 and define directions along the x-, y-, and z-axes. A vector \( \vec{A} = A_x \hat{i} + A_y \hat{j} \) uses unit vectors to express components concisely. The unit vector of \( \vec{A} \) is \( \hat{A} = \frac{\vec{A}}{A} \), where \( A = \sqrt{A_x^2 + A_y^2} \). JEE/NEET problems often require unit vector calculations for direction analysis in mechanics and electromagnetism.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem gives a velocity \( \vec{v} = 3 \hat{i} + 4 \hat{j} \, \text{m/s} \). Find the unit vector.
- **Solution**: Magnitude \( v = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = 5 \, \text{m/s} \). Unit vector \( \hat{v} = \frac{\vec{v}}{v} = \frac{3 \hat{i} + 4 \hat{j}}{5} = 0.6 \hat{i} + 0.8 \hat{j} \). This is a typical NEET vector direction question.

## 3.5 Scalar and Vector Products

### Scalar (Dot) Product
The scalar product of vectors \( \vec{A} \) and \( \vec{B} \) is \( \vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} = AB \cos\theta \), where \( \theta \) is the angle between them. It yields a scalar, used in JEE/NEET for work (\( \vec{F} \cdot \vec{d} \)) or angle calculations. In component form, \( \vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} = A_x B_x + A_y B_y \).

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves vectors \( \vec{A} = 2 \hat{i} + 3 \hat{j} \) and \( \vec{B} = 4 \hat{i} - \hat{j} \). Calculate the dot product.
- **Solution**: \( \vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} = (2 \times 4) + (3 \times -1) = 8 - 3 = 5 \). This scalar result is common in JEE work-energy problems.

### Vector (Cross) Product
The vector product \( \vec{A} \times \vec{B} = AB \sin\theta \hat{n} \) yields a vector perpendicular to \( \vec{A} \) and \( \vec{B} \), with direction given by the right-hand rule. Its magnitude is \( AB \sin\theta \). In components, \( \vec{A} \times \vec{B} = (A_x B_y - A_y B_x) \hat{k} \) (for 2D). JEE/NEET test cross products in torque (\( \vec{r} \times \vec{F} \)) and angular momentum. *University Physics* highlights applications in magnetic fields.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves \( \vec{A} = 3 \hat{i} + 2 \hat{j} \), \( \vec{B} = - \hat{i} + 4 \hat{j} \). Calculate the cross product.
- **Solution**: \( \vec{A} \times \vec{B} = (A_x B_y - A_y B_x) \hat{k} = (3 \times 4 - 2 \times (-1)) \hat{k} = (12 + 2) \hat{k} = 14 \hat{k} \). This vector result is tested in JEE torque problems.
