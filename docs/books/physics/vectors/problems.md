# Vectors Problems

This section provides **100 problems** to test your understanding of vector concepts, including scalars, vector addition and subtraction, components, unit vectors, and scalar and vector products. Inspired by JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs), these problems are tailored for exam preparation, offering a mix of numerical, conceptual, and derivation-based challenges. They are organized by difficulty and type to support progressive learning and build confidence for competitive exams.

## Problem Types
- **JEE Main PYQ-Style (35)**: Numerical, straightforward problems focusing on vector addition, components, and dot products (e.g., resultant displacement, work calculations).
- **JEE Advanced PYQ-Style (30)**: Conceptual, multi-step problems requiring derivations or complex applications (e.g., cross products for torque, unit vector analysis).
- **NEET PYQ-Style (35)**: Practical, conceptual problems emphasizing real-world applications (e.g., velocity vectors in motion, force resolution).

## Problems
Below are **10 sample problems** from the set of 100, covering the range of difficulty and types. The full set includes 40 numerical, 40 conceptual, and 20 derivation-based problems, ensuring comprehensive coverage of vector topics.

1. **JEE Main**: A vector \( \vec{A} = 5 \hat{i} + 12 \hat{j} \) m represents a displacement. Calculate its magnitude.
