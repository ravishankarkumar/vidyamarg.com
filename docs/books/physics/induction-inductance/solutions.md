# Induction and Inductance Solutions

This section provides **solutions** to the 100 induction and inductance problems, offering step-by-step explanations and strategies for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET. Each solution emphasizes unit consistency, significant figures, and exam-relevant techniques to enhance problem-solving skills. Problems are inspired by JEE/NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs) from 2020–2024, with year and paper details indicating style and difficulty. NEET-style problems (66–100) are solved as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to align with the exam’s objective format.

## Solutions to Sample Problems
1. **Problem 1 (JEE Main, 2023 Paper 1)**: A circular loop (radius 0.2 m) in a magnetic field \( B = 0.4 \, \text{T} \) decreasing at 0.01 T/s. Calculate the induced EMF.
   - **Solution**: Flux: \( \Phi_B = B \pi r^2 \). Given \( r = 0.2 \, \text{m} \), \( \pi r^2 = \pi \times 0.04 = 0.1257 \, \text{m}^2 \). Rate: \( \frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dB}{dt} = 0.1257 \times (-0.01) = -1.257 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{Wb/s} \). EMF: \( \mathcal{E} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} = 1.257 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{V} \approx 5.03 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{V} \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025).
     - **Answer**: (b) 5.03 × 10⁻³ V
     - **JEE Tip**: Compute area; ignore negative sign for magnitude. Common error: Incorrect radius squared.

66. **Problem 66 (NEET, 2023)**: What does Faraday’s law describe?
   - **Solution**: Faraday’s law describes the induced EMF due to a changing magnetic flux, \( \mathcal{E} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} \). Example: A loop in a decreasing field induces an EMF.
     - **Answer**: (a) Induced EMF
     - **NEET Tip**: Focus on flux change; distinguish from Lenz’s law. Common error: Confusing with force.

**Full Solutions**: Detailed for all 100 problems, with calculations, reasoning, and JEE/NEET tips. *Due to volume, sample solutions are shown. Request the complete set for inclusion.*
