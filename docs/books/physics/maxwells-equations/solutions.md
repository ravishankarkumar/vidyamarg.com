# Maxwell’s Equations; Magnetism of Matter Solutions

This section provides **solutions** to the 100 Maxwell’s equations and magnetism of matter problems, offering step-by-step explanations and strategies for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET. Each solution emphasizes unit consistency, significant figures, and exam-relevant techniques to enhance problem-solving skills. Problems are inspired by JEE/NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs) from 2020–2024, with year and paper details indicating style and difficulty. NEET-style problems (66–100) are solved as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to align with the exam’s objective format.

## Solutions to Sample Problems
1. **Problem 1 (JEE Main, 2023 Paper 1)**: A capacitor with plates of area 0.05 m², separation 0.002 m, charging at 3 A/s. Calculate the displacement current (\( \epsilon_0 = 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{C}^2/\text{N·m}^2 \)).
   - **Solution**: Displacement current: \( I_d = \epsilon_0 \frac{d\Phi_E}{dt} \). Flux: \( \Phi_E = E A \), where \( E = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0 A} \), so \( \Phi_E = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0} \). Rate: \( \frac{d\Phi_E}{dt} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \frac{dQ}{dt} = \frac{I}{\epsilon_0} \). Given \( I = 3 \, \text{A} \): \( I_d = I = 3 \, \text{A} \approx 3.00 \, \text{A} \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025).
     - **Answer**: (b) 3.00 A
     - **JEE Tip**: Displacement current equals conduction current; verify units. Common error: Calculating flux incorrectly.

66. **Problem 66 (NEET, 2023)**: What does Gauss’s law for magnetism describe?
   - **Solution**: Gauss’s law for magnetism, \( \oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{A} = 0 \) (\( \nabla \cdot \vec{B} = 0 \)), describes the zero divergence of the magnetic field, indicating no magnetic monopoles. Example: Magnetic field lines form closed loops.
     - **Answer**: (a) Zero divergence
     - **NEET Tip**: Focus on absence of monopoles; distinguish from electric law. Common error: Confusing with Gauss’s electric law.

**Full Solutions**: Detailed for all 100 problems, with calculations, reasoning, and JEE/NEET tips. *Due to volume, sample solutions are shown. Request the complete set for inclusion.*
