# Chapter 38: Photons and Matter Waves

Photons and matter waves form the foundation of quantum mechanics, revealing the dual nature of light and matter, with applications in technologies like solar cells and electron microscopy. This chapter explores the photoelectric effect and photon properties, Compton scattering, de Broglie waves and matter wave properties, and wave-particle duality. These concepts are critical for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET, appearing in problems on photon energy, wavelength calculations, and quantum effects. With clear explanations, exam-focused examples, and robust problem-solving strategies, this chapter equips students to master quantum physics in competitive exams, ensuring precision and conceptual clarity.

## 38.1 The Photoelectric Effect and Photon Properties

The **photoelectric effect** demonstrates that light consists of **photons**, each with energy \( E = hf \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) is Planck’s constant and \( f \) is frequency. The photon’s momentum is \( p = \frac{h}{\lambda} \), and the photoelectric equation is \( hf = \phi + K_{\text{max}} \), where \( \phi \) is the work function and \( K_{\text{max}} \) is the maximum kinetic energy of ejected electrons. JEE/NEET problems involve calculating photon energy, threshold frequency, or stopping potential. *Fundamentals of Physics* emphasizes the particle nature of light.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves light of wavelength 400 nm incident on a metal with work function 2.0 eV. Calculate the maximum kinetic energy of ejected electrons (\( h = 4.136 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{eV·s} \), \( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)).
- **Solution**: Photon energy: \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \). Given \( \lambda = 400 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \): \( E = \frac{4.136 \times 10^{-15} \times 3.00 \times 10^8}{400 \times 10^{-9}} = \frac{1.241 \times 10^{-6}}{4 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 3.103 \, \text{eV} \). Photoelectric equation: \( K_{\text{max}} = E - \phi = 3.103 - 2.0 = 1.103 \, \text{eV} \approx 1.10 \, \text{eV} \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025). This is a standard JEE photoelectric problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Convert wavelength to meters; subtract work function. Common error: Incorrect units for \( h \).

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks the key requirement for the photoelectric effect.
- **Solution**: The photoelectric effect requires the photon energy to **exceed the work function** (\( hf > \phi \)). Option (a) “Photon energy > work function” is correct. This is a typical NEET photoelectric problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Photoelectric effect is photon-driven; focus on energy threshold. Common error: Confusing with thermal emission.

## 38.2 Compton Scattering

**Compton scattering** shows photons scattering off electrons, with a wavelength shift given by \( \Delta \lambda = \frac{h}{m_e c} (1 - \cos \theta) \), where \( m_e = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \) is the electron mass, and \( \theta \) is the scattering angle. The Compton wavelength is \( \frac{h}{m_e c} \approx 2.426 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{m} \). JEE/NEET problems involve calculating wavelength shifts or scattered photon energy. *University Physics* connects Compton scattering to quantum evidence for light’s particle nature.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves a photon of wavelength 0.01 nm scattering off an electron at 90°. Calculate the wavelength shift (\( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( m_e = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \), \( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)).
- **Solution**: Compton shift: \( \Delta \lambda = \frac{h}{m_e c} (1 - \cos \theta) \). Given \( \theta = 90^\circ \), \( \cos 90^\circ = 0 \): \( \Delta \lambda = \frac{h}{m_e c} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{9.11 \times 10^{-31} \times 3.00 \times 10^8} \approx 2.426 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{m} = 0.002426 \, \text{nm} \approx 0.00243 \, \text{nm} \). This is a classic JEE Compton problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Use Compton wavelength; check angle. Common error: Omitting \( 1 - \cos \theta \).

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks the cause of the Compton effect.
- **Solution**: The Compton effect results from **photon-electron scattering**, increasing the photon’s wavelength. Option (a) “Photon-electron scattering” is correct. This is a typical NEET Compton problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Compton effect shows particle nature; focus on wavelength shift. Common error: Confusing with photoelectric effect.

## 38.3 De Broglie Waves and Matter Wave Properties

**De Broglie waves** assign a wavelength to matter: \( \lambda = \frac{h}{p} \), where \( p = mv \) is momentum. For relativistic particles, \( p = \gamma m_0 v \). The wave nature of matter explains electron diffraction and quantum behavior. JEE/NEET problems involve calculating de Broglie wavelengths or interpreting wave properties. *Fundamentals of Physics* highlights de Broglie’s role in quantum mechanics.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves an electron with velocity \( 2.0 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \). Calculate its de Broglie wavelength (\( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( m_e = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \)).
- **Solution**: De Broglie wavelength: \( \lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{h}{m_e v} \). Given \( v = 2.0 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \): \( p = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \times 2.0 \times 10^6 = 1.822 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{kg·m/s} \). \( \lambda = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{1.822 \times 10^{-24}} \approx 3.636 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} = 0.364 \, \text{nm} \approx 0.36 \, \text{nm} \). This is a standard JEE de Broglie problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Compute momentum first; convert to nm. Common error: Incorrect mass units.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks the de Broglie hypothesis.
- **Solution**: The de Broglie hypothesis states that **matter has wave-like properties**, with wavelength \( \lambda = \frac{h}{p} \). Option (a) “Matter waves” is correct. This is a typical NEET de Broglie problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: De Broglie applies to all matter; focus on wavelength. Common error: Confusing with photon momentum.

## 38.4 Wave-Particle Duality and Applications

**Wave-particle duality** describes light and matter exhibiting both particle and wave properties, evidenced by the photoelectric effect, Compton scattering, and electron diffraction. Applications include electron microscopy, quantum tunneling, and spectroscopy. JEE/NEET problems involve interpreting duality or calculating related quantities. *University Physics* connects duality to quantum technologies.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves a photon and an electron with the same de Broglie wavelength of 0.1 nm. Calculate the photon’s energy (\( h = 4.136 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{eV·s} \), \( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)).
- **Solution**: Photon wavelength: \( \lambda = \frac{h}{p} \), so \( p = \frac{h}{\lambda} \). Energy: \( E = pc = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \). Given \( \lambda = 0.1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \): \( E = \frac{4.136 \times 10^{-15} \times 3.00 \times 10^8}{0.1 \times 10^{-9}} = \frac{1.241 \times 10^{-6}}{10^{-10}} = 1.241 \times 10^4 \, \text{eV} = 12.41 \, \text{keV} \approx 12.4 \, \text{keV} \). This is a classic JEE duality problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Use \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \) for photons; convert to keV. Common error: Using electron energy formula.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks the significance of wave-particle duality.
- **Solution**: Wave-particle duality shows that **light and matter** have both wave and particle properties, explaining phenomena like diffraction and the photoelectric effect. Option (a) “Dual nature” is correct. This is a typical NEET duality problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Duality unifies quantum behavior; relate to experiments. Common error: Limiting to light only.
