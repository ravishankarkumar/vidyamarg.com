# Photons and Matter Waves Solutions

This section provides **solutions** to the 100 photons and matter waves problems, offering step-by-step explanations and strategies for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET. Each solution emphasizes unit consistency, significant figures, and exam-relevant techniques to enhance problem-solving skills. Problems are inspired by JEE/NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs) from 2020–2024, with year and paper details indicating style and difficulty. NEET-style problems (66–100) are solved as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to align with the exam’s objective format.

## Solutions to Sample Problems
1. **Problem 1 (JEE Main, 2023 Paper 1)**: Light of wavelength 500 nm is incident on a metal with work function 1.5 eV. Calculate the maximum kinetic energy of ejected electrons (\( h = 4.136 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{eV·s} \), \( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)).
   - **Solution**: Photon energy: \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \). Given \( \lambda = 500 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \): \( E = \frac{4.136 \times 10^{-15} \times 3.00 \times 10^8}{500 \times 10^{-9}} = \frac{1.241 \times 10^{-6}}{5 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 2.482 \, \text{eV} \). Photoelectric equation: \( K_{\text{max}} = E - \phi = 2.482 - 1.5 = 0.982 \, \text{eV} \approx 0.98 \, \text{eV} \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025).
     - **Answer**: (a) 0.98 eV
     - **JEE Tip**: Convert wavelength to meters; subtract work function. Common error: Using incorrect \( h \).

66. **Problem 66 (NEET, 2023)**: What causes the photoelectric effect?
   - **Solution**: The photoelectric effect is caused by the absorption of photons by metal electrons, providing enough energy to overcome the work function and eject electrons. Example: UV light on a metal surface emits electrons.
     - **Answer**: (a) Photon absorption
     - **NEET Tip**: Focus on photon energy; distinguish from thermal effects. Common error: Confusing with Compton scattering.

**Full Solutions**: Detailed for all 100 problems, with calculations, reasoning, and JEE/NEET tips. *Due to volume, sample solutions are shown. Request the complete set for inclusion.*
