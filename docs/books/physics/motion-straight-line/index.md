# Chapter 2: Motion Along a Straight Line

Kinematics, the study of motion without considering its causes, is a cornerstone of physics. This chapter focuses on motion along a straight line, exploring concepts such as position, displacement, velocity, acceleration, constant acceleration, and free-fall. These principles are fundamental for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET, appearing in problems across mechanics, such as projectile motion, vehicle dynamics, and gravitational effects. With clear explanations, exam-focused examples, and rigorous problem-solving strategies, this chapter equips students to tackle numerical and conceptual challenges in competitive exams, ensuring precision and confidence.

## 2.1 Position, Displacement, and Average Velocity

### Position and Displacement
Position defines an object’s location relative to a reference point, often represented as \( x \) on a straight line (e.g., a number line in meters). Displacement, a vector quantity, is the change in position, given by \( \Delta x = x_2 - x_1 \), where \( x_2 \) and \( x_1 \) are final and initial positions. Unlike distance (a scalar), displacement includes direction, critical for JEE/NEET problems involving motion analysis.

**Solved Example**: A JEE problem involves a car moving from \( x_1 = 10 \, \text{m} \) to \( x_2 = -5 \, \text{m} \). Calculate the displacement.
- **Solution**: \( \Delta x = x_2 - x_1 = -5 - 10 = -15 \, \text{m} \). The negative sign indicates motion in the negative direction, a common JEE kinematics question.

### Average Velocity
Average velocity, a vector, is defined as displacement divided by time interval: \( v_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} \). It differs from average speed, a scalar based on total distance. For JEE/NEET, average velocity is tested in problems involving straight-line motion, such as vehicles or particles.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem tracks a runner moving 100 m east in 20 s, then 50 m west in 10 s. Calculate the average velocity.
- **Solution**: Total displacement = 100 m (east) - 50 m (west) = 50 m (east). Total time = 20 s + 10 s = 30 s. Thus, \( v_{\text{avg}} = \frac{50}{30} = 1.67 \, \text{m/s} \) (east, 3 significant figures, April 14, 2025).

## 2.2 Instantaneous Velocity and Speed

Instantaneous velocity is the velocity at a specific moment, defined as the derivative of position with respect to time: \( v = \frac{dx}{dt} \). For straight-line motion, it’s the slope of the position-time graph. Instantaneous speed is the magnitude of velocity, a scalar. JEE/NEET problems often require interpreting graphs or calculating velocity at a given point.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem gives a position function \( x(t) = 2t^2 + 3t \) (in meters, seconds). Find the instantaneous velocity at \( t = 2 \, \text{s} \).
- **Solution**: \( v = \frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(2t^2 + 3t) = 4t + 3 \). At \( t = 2 \), \( v = 4 \times 2 + 3 = 11 \, \text{m/s} \). This calculus-based approach is typical for JEE Advanced kinematics.

## 2.3 Acceleration

Acceleration measures the rate of change of velocity, a vector defined as \( a_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} \) (average) or \( a = \frac{dv}{dt} \) (instantaneous). In SI units, acceleration is in m/s². For JEE/NEET, acceleration is key in problems involving changing velocities, such as vehicles speeding up or objects in free fall. *University Physics* notes real-world examples, like car acceleration in autonomous vehicles, tested in advanced JEE questions.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves a bike accelerating from 5 m/s to 15 m/s in 4 s. Calculate the average acceleration.
- **Solution**: \( a_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{15 - 5}{4} = 2.5 \, \text{m/s}^2 \). Reported to 2 significant figures, this is a standard NEET numerical.

## 2.4 Constant Acceleration

Constant acceleration occurs when acceleration is unchanging, common in JEE/NEET problems involving vehicles or free-fall motion. The kinematic equations for constant acceleration are:
1. \( v = u + at \)
2. \( x = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2 \)
3. \( v^2 = u^2 + 2ax \)
4. \( x = \frac{(u + v)}{2}t \)
where \( u \) is initial velocity, \( v \) is final velocity, \( a \) is acceleration, \( t \) is time, and \( x \) is displacement.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves a car starting from rest (\( u = 0 \)) with \( a = 2 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) for 10 s. Calculate the displacement.
- **Solution**: Use \( x = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2 \). Since \( u = 0 \), \( x = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 10^2 = 100 \, \text{m} \) (2 significant figures, April 14, 2025). This equation is frequently tested in JEE kinematics.

## 2.5 Free-Fall Acceleration

Free-fall acceleration, due to gravity, is approximately \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) near Earth’s surface, directed downward. Objects in free fall experience constant acceleration, ignoring air resistance. JEE/NEET problems often involve falling objects or projectiles, requiring the kinematic equations with \( a = -g \) (upward positive).

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves a ball dropped from a 20 m height. Calculate the time to reach the ground (\( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)).
- **Solution**: Use \( x = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2 \). Since \( u = 0 \), \( a = -9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), \( x = -20 \, \text{m} \), we get \( -20 = \frac{1}{2} \times (-9.8) \times t^2 \). Solving, \( t^2 = \frac{-20}{-4.9} \approx 4.08 \), so \( t \approx 2.02 \, \text{s} \) (3 significant figures).

## Review & Summary
- **Position and Displacement**: Position (\( x \)) is a location; displacement (\( \Delta x = x_2 - x_1 \)) is the vector change in position.
- **Average Velocity**: \( v_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} \), distinct from average speed (scalar).
- **Instantaneous Velocity**: \( v = \frac{dx}{dt} \), the slope of the position-time graph.
- **Acceleration**: Rate of velocity change, \( a_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} \), \( a = \frac{dv}{dt} \), measured in m/s².
- **Constant Acceleration**: Uses kinematic equations (e.g., \( v = u + at \)), common in vehicle and free-fall problems.
- **Free-Fall**: Constant acceleration \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) downward, applied in falling object scenarios.
