# Motion Along a Straight Line Solutions

This section provides **solutions** to the 100 kinematics problems, offering step-by-step explanations and strategies for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET. Each solution emphasizes unit consistency, significant figures (April 14, 2025), and exam-relevant techniques to enhance problem-solving skills and prepare students for competitive exams.

## Solutions to Sample Problems
1. **JEE Main**: A car travels 120 m in 8 s with constant velocity. Calculate the average velocity.
   - **Solution**: \( v_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \, \text{m/s} \) (2 significant figures). **Answer**: (b) 15 m/s.
2. **NEET**: A ball is dropped from 45 m (\( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)). Calculate the time to reach the ground.
   - **Solution**: Use \( x = \frac{1}{2}gt^2 \). For \( x = -45 \, \text{m} \), \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), \( -45 = \frac{1}{2} \times (-9.8) \times t^2 \). Solving, \( t^2 = \frac{-45}{-4.9} \approx 9.18 \), \( t \approx 3.03 \, \text{s} \). **Answer**: (b) 3 s (rounded).
3. **JEE Advanced**: Derive \( v^2 = u^2 + 2ax \) using integration.
   - **Solution**: Acceleration \( a = \frac{dv}{dt} \). Rearrange: \( dv = a \, dt \). Since \( a = \frac{dv}{dx} \cdot \frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{dv}{dx} \cdot v \), we get \( a \, dx = v \, dv \). Integrate: \( \int_0^x a \, dx = \int_u^v v \, dv \). Thus, \( ax = \frac{1}{2}v^2 - \frac{1}{2}u^2 \), so \( v^2 = u^2 + 2ax \).
4. **NEET**: A cyclist moves with 4 m/s for 10 s. Calculate the displacement.
   - **Solution**: Displacement = velocity × time = 4 × 10 = 40 m (2 significant figures).
5. **JEE Main**: A train accelerates from 10 m/s to 30 m/s in 5 s. Calculate the average acceleration.
   - **Solution**: \( a_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{30 - 10}{5} = 4 \, \text{m/s}^2 \). **Answer**: (b) 4 m/s².
6. **JEE Advanced**: \( x(t) = 3t^2 - 2t + 1 \). Find velocity at \( t = 3 \, \text{s} \).
   - **Solution**: \( v = \frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(3t^2 - 2t + 1) = 6t - 2 \). At \( t = 3 \), \( v = 6 \times 3 - 2 = 16 \, \text{m/s} \).
7. **NEET**: A stone is thrown upward with 20 m/s (\( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)). Calculate maximum height.
   - **Solution**: At maximum height, \( v = 0 \). Use \( v^2 = u^2 + 2ax \). Here, \( u = 20 \, \text{m/s} \), \( a = -9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), \( 0 = 20^2 + 2(-9.8)h \). Solving, \( h = \frac{400}{19.6} \approx 20.41 \, \text{m} \).
8. **JEE Main**: A bus starts from rest, accelerates at 1.5 m/s² for 12 s. Calculate final velocity.
   - **Solution**: \( v = u + at = 0 + 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \, \text{m/s} \). **Answer**: (b) 18 m/s.
9. **JEE Advanced**: Velocity-time graph has slope 2 m/s², initial velocity 5 m/s. Find velocity after 4 s.
   - **Solution**: Slope = acceleration = 2 m/s². Use \( v = u + at = 5 + 2 \times 4 = 13 \, \text{m/s} \).
10. **NEET**: A ball falls freely for 3 s (\( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)). Calculate distance traveled.
    - **Solution**: \( x = \frac{1}{2}gt^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 9.8 \times 3^2 = 44.1 \, \text{m} \).
