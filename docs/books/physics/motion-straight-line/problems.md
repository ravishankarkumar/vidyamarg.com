# Motion Along a Straight Line Problems

This section provides **100 problems** to test your understanding of motion along a straight line, including position, displacement, velocity, acceleration, constant acceleration, and free-fall. Inspired by JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs), these problems are tailored for exam preparation, offering a mix of numerical, conceptual, and derivation-based challenges. They are organized by difficulty and type to support progressive learning and build confidence for competitive exams.

## Problem Types
- **JEE Main PYQ-Style (35)**: Numerical, straightforward problems focusing on velocity, displacement, and constant acceleration (e.g., calculating time of motion).
- **JEE Advanced PYQ-Style (30)**: Conceptual, multi-step problems requiring graph analysis or derivations (e.g., velocity-time slopes, kinematic equations).
- **NEET PYQ-Style (35)**: Practical, conceptual problems emphasizing real-world applications (e.g., free-fall in biomechanics, vehicle motion).

## Problems
Below are **10 sample problems** from the set of 100, covering the range of difficulty and types. The full set includes 40 numerical, 40 conceptual, and 20 derivation-based problems, ensuring comprehensive coverage of kinematics topics.

1. **JEE Main**: A car travels 120 m in 8 s with constant velocity. Calculate the average velocity.
   - Options: (a) 10 m/s (b) 15 m/s (c) 20 m/s (d) 25 m/s
2. **NEET**: A ball is dropped from a height of 45 m (\( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)). Calculate the time to reach the ground.
   - Options: (a) 2 s (b) 3 s (c) 4 s (d) 5 s
3. **JEE Advanced**: Derive the kinematic equation \( v^2 = u^2 + 2ax \) using integration.
4. **NEET**: A cyclist moves with a constant velocity of 4 m/s for 10 s. Calculate the displacement.
5. **JEE Main**: A train accelerates uniformly from 10 m/s to 30 m/s in 5 s. Calculate the average acceleration.
   - Options: (a) 2 m/s² (b) 4 m/s² (c) 6 m/s² (d) 8 m/s²
6. **JEE Advanced**: A particle’s position is given by \( x(t) = 3t^2 - 2t + 1 \) (m, s). Find the instantaneous velocity at \( t = 3 \, \text{s} \).
7. **NEET**: A stone is thrown upward with an initial velocity of 20 m/s (\( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)). Calculate the maximum height.
8. **JEE Main**: A bus starts from rest and accelerates at 1.5 m/s² for 12 s. Calculate the final velocity.
   - Options: (a) 15 m/s (b) 18 m/s (c) 20 m/s (d) 22 m/s
9. **JEE Advanced**: The velocity-time graph of a particle is a straight line with slope 2 m/s². If the initial velocity is 5 m/s, find the velocity after 4 s.
10. **NEET**: A ball falls freely for 3 s (\( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)). Calculate the distance traveled.

**Full Problem Set**: The complete set of 100 problems includes:
- **Numerical (40)**: Calculations of velocity, displacement, time, and acceleration (e.g., free-fall, vehicle motion).
- **Conceptual (40)**: Questions on graph interpretation, velocity vs. speed, and acceleration signs.
- **Derivations (20)**: Deriving kinematic equations or analyzing motion equations.
