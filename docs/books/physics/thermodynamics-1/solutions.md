# Thermodynamics Solutions

This section provides **solutions** to the 100 thermodynamics problems, offering step-by-step explanations and strategies for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET. Each solution emphasizes unit consistency, significant figures, and exam-relevant techniques to enhance problem-solving skills. Problems are inspired by JEE/NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs) from 2020–2024, with year and paper details indicating style and difficulty [Web:0, Web:8]. NEET-style problems (66–100) are solved as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to align with the exam’s objective format [Web:9, Web:15].

## Solutions to Sample Problems
1. **Problem 1 (JEE Main, 2023 Paper 1)**: A system is at 37°C. Convert this temperature to Kelvin.
   - **Solution**: Kelvin temperature: \( T_K = T_C + 273.15 \). Given \( T_C = 37 \, \text{°C} \): \( T_K = 37 + 273.15 = 310.15 \, \text{K} \approx 310 \, \text{K} \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025).
     - **Answer**: (b) 310 K
     - **JEE Tip**: Add 273.15; use precise constant. Common error: Using 273 or omitting decimal.

66. **Problem 66 (NEET, 2023)**: What is temperature in thermodynamics?
   - **Solution**: Temperature measures the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance, determining heat flow direction. Example: A hot cup of tea cools as particles transfer kinetic energy to the surroundings. Option (a) correctly defines this.
     - **Answer**: (a) Measure of particle kinetic energy
     - **NEET Tip**: Focus on kinetic energy; distinguish from total energy. Common error: Confusing with heat or work.

**Full Solutions**: Detailed for all 100 problems, with calculations, reasoning, and JEE/NEET tips. *Due to volume, sample solutions are shown. Request the complete set for inclusion.*
