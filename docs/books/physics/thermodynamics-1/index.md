# Chapter 18: Temperature, Heat, and the First Law of Thermodynamics

Thermodynamics studies energy transformations involving heat and work, fundamental to systems like engines and biological processes. This chapter explores temperature and thermometers, heat and specific heat, work in thermodynamic processes, and the first law of thermodynamics. These concepts are critical for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET, appearing in problems on heat transfer, internal energy, and work calculations. With clear explanations, exam-focused examples, and robust problem-solving strategies, this chapter equips students to master thermodynamics in competitive exams, ensuring precision and conceptual clarity.

## 18.1 Temperature and Thermometers

**Temperature** measures the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance, quantified using scales like Celsius (°C), Kelvin (K), and Fahrenheit (°F). The **Kelvin scale** is absolute, with 0 K at absolute zero; \( T_K = T_C + 273.15 \). **Thermometers** (e.g., mercury, alcohol) measure temperature via thermal expansion or other properties. JEE/NEET problems involve converting temperatures or calculating thermal equilibrium. *Fundamentals of Physics* emphasizes absolute temperature in thermodynamic calculations.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves a system at 25°C. Convert this temperature to Kelvin.
- **Solution**: Kelvin temperature: \( T_K = T_C + 273.15 \). Given \( T_C = 25 \, \text{°C} \): \( T_K = 25 + 273.15 = 298.15 \, \text{K} \approx 298 \, \text{K} \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025). This is a standard JEE temperature conversion problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Add 273.15 for Celsius to Kelvin; use precise constants. Common error: Using 273 or omitting decimal.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves two objects (masses 0.1 kg, 0.2 kg; temperatures 80°C, 20°C) mixed to reach equilibrium. Calculate the final temperature (specific heats equal, no phase change).
- **Solution**: At thermal equilibrium, heat lost equals heat gained: \( m_1 c (T_1 - T_f) = m_2 c (T_f - T_2) \). Given \( m_1 = 0.1 \, \text{kg} \), \( T_1 = 80 \, \text{°C} \), \( m_2 = 0.2 \, \text{kg} \), \( T_2 = 20 \, \text{°C} \): \( c \) cancels, so \( 0.1 (80 - T_f) = 0.2 (T_f - 20) \). Simplify: \( 8 - 0.1 T_f = 0.2 T_f - 4 \), \( 12 = 0.3 T_f \), \( T_f = \frac{12}{0.3} = 40 \, \text{°C} \) (2 significant figures). This is a typical NEET equilibrium problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Assume no heat loss; specific heats cancel if equal. Common error: Incorrect mass or temperature differences.

## 18.2 Heat and Specific Heat

**Heat** (\( Q \)) is energy transferred due to a temperature difference, measured in joules (J). **Specific heat** (\( c \)) is the heat required to raise 1 kg of a substance by 1 K: \( Q = m c \Delta T \). For water, \( c \approx 4186 \, \text{J/kg·K} \). **Latent heat** (\( L \)) applies during phase changes: \( Q = m L \). JEE/NEET problems involve calculating heat for temperature changes or phase transitions. *University Physics* connects heat to material properties, tested in NEET.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves heating 0.5 kg of water from 20°C to 80°C (no phase change, \( c = 4186 \, \text{J/kg·K} \)). Calculate the heat required.
- **Solution**: Heat: \( Q = m c \Delta T \). Given \( m = 0.5 \, \text{kg} \), \( c = 4186 \, \text{J/kg·K} \), \( \Delta T = 80 - 20 = 60 \, \text{K} \): \( Q = 0.5 \times 4186 \times 60 = 125580 \, \text{J} \approx 126000 \, \text{J} \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025). This is a standard JEE heat problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Use SI units; check temperature difference. Common error: Including phase change or incorrect \( c \).

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves melting 0.2 kg of ice at 0°C to water at 0°C (latent heat of fusion \( L_f = 334000 \, \text{J/kg} \)). Calculate the heat required.
- **Solution**: Heat for phase change: \( Q = m L_f \). Given \( m = 0.2 \, \text{kg} \), \( L_f = 334000 \, \text{J/kg} \): \( Q = 0.2 \times 334000 = 66800 \, \text{J} \approx 67000 \, \text{J} \) (2 significant figures). This is a typical NEET latent heat problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Use latent heat for phase change; no temperature change. Common error: Including specific heat or incorrect \( L_f \).

## 18.3 Work and Heat in Thermodynamic Processes

In thermodynamics, **work** (\( W \)) is done by or on a gas during volume changes: \( W = \int P dV \). For an isobaric process, \( W = P \Delta V \). **Heat** (\( Q \)) transfers energy, and both affect internal energy. JEE/NEET problems involve calculating work in processes like isothermal or isobaric expansions. *Fundamentals of Physics* emphasizes work as a path-dependent quantity.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves a gas expanding isobarically at 2 atm from 1 L to 3 L. Calculate the work done (1 atm = 101325 Pa).
- **Solution**: Work: \( W = P \Delta V \). Given \( P = 2 \times 101325 = 202650 \, \text{Pa} \), \( \Delta V = (3 - 1) \times 10^{-3} = 2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^3 \): \( W = 202650 \times 2 \times 10^{-3} = 405.3 \, \text{J} \approx 405 \, \text{J} \) (3 significant figures). This is a classic JEE work problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Convert volumes to m³; use SI units for pressure. Common error: Incorrect volume units or pressure conversion.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves a gas doing 500 J of work while absorbing 800 J of heat. Calculate the change in internal energy.
- **Solution**: First law: \( \Delta U = Q - W \). Given \( Q = 800 \, \text{J} \) (heat absorbed, positive), \( W = 500 \, \text{J} \) (work done by gas, positive): \( \Delta U = 800 - 500 = 300 \, \text{J} \) (3 significant figures). This is a typical NEET first law problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Use sign convention: \( Q \) positive for heat in, \( W \) positive for work by gas. Common error: Incorrect signs or units.

## 18.4 First Law of Thermodynamics

The **first law of thermodynamics** is a statement of energy conservation: \( \Delta U = Q - W \), where \( \Delta U \) is the change in internal energy, \( Q \) is heat added to the system, and \( W \) is work done by the system. For an ideal gas, \( \Delta U = n C_V \Delta T \), where \( C_V \) is the molar specific heat at constant volume. JEE/NEET problems involve applying the first law to processes like adiabatic or isothermal. *University Physics* connects the first law to energy transformations.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves an ideal gas (1 mole, \( C_V = \frac{3}{2} R \)) undergoing an isothermal process at 300 K, absorbing 1200 J of heat. Calculate the work done by the gas (\( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K} \)).
- **Solution**: For isothermal process (\( \Delta T = 0 \)), \( \Delta U = n C_V \Delta T = 0 \). First law: \( \Delta U = Q - W \), so \( W = Q \). Given \( Q = 1200 \, \text{J} \): \( W = 1200 \, \text{J} \) (3 significant figures). This is a classic JEE isothermal problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Isothermal process: \( \Delta U = 0 \); work equals heat. Common error: Assuming non-zero \( \Delta U \).

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves an adiabatic process for an ideal gas (1 mole, \( C_V = \frac{5}{2} R \)) with temperature decreasing from 400 K to 300 K. Calculate the change in internal energy.
- **Solution**: Internal energy: \( \Delta U = n C_V \Delta T \). Given \( n = 1 \, \text{mol} \), \( C_V = \frac{5}{2} \times 8.314 = 20.785 \, \text{J/mol·K} \), \( \Delta T = 300 - 400 = -100 \, \text{K} \): \( \Delta U = 1 \times 20.785 \times (-100) = -2078.5 \, \text{J} \approx -2080 \, \text{J} \) (3 significant figures). This is a typical NEET adiabatic problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Adiabatic: \( Q = 0 \); \( \Delta U \) depends on \( \Delta T \). Common error: Including heat or incorrect \( C_V \).
