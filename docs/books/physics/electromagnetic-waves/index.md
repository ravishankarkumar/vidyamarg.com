# Chapter 33: Electromagnetic Waves

Electromagnetic waves, predicted by Maxwell’s equations, are oscillating electric and magnetic fields that propagate through space, enabling technologies like radio, Wi-Fi, and medical imaging. This chapter explores the nature and properties of electromagnetic waves, the electromagnetic spectrum and wave propagation, energy and intensity of electromagnetic waves, and polarization. These concepts are critical for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET, appearing in problems on wave characteristics, energy calculations, and optical phenomena. With clear explanations, exam-focused examples, and robust problem-solving strategies, this chapter equips students to master electromagnetic waves in competitive exams, ensuring precision and conceptual clarity.

## 33.1 Nature and Properties of Electromagnetic Waves

**Electromagnetic waves** are transverse waves with mutually perpendicular electric (\( \vec{E} \)) and magnetic (\( \vec{B} \)) fields, propagating at the speed of light \( c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \epsilon_0}} \approx 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). They obey the wave equation, with \( E = c B \), and require no medium. JEE/NEET problems involve calculating wave speed or field relationships. *Fundamentals of Physics* emphasizes their derivation from Maxwell’s equations.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves an electromagnetic wave with an electric field amplitude \( E_0 = 120 \, \text{V/m} \). Calculate the magnetic field amplitude.
- **Solution**: Field relation: \( E_0 = c B_0 \). Given \( E_0 = 120 \, \text{V/m} \), \( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \): \( B_0 = \frac{E_0}{c} = \frac{120}{3.00 \times 10^8} = 4.00 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{T} \approx 4.00 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{T} \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025). This is a standard JEE wave problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Use \( E = c B \); ensure units match. Common error: Incorrect \( c \) value.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks the speed of electromagnetic waves in a vacuum.
- **Solution**: Electromagnetic waves travel at the **speed of light**, \( c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \epsilon_0}} \approx 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Option (a) “3.00 × 10⁸ m/s” is correct. This is a typical NEET wave property problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Speed is constant in vacuum; no medium required. Common error: Assuming dependence on medium.

## 33.2 Electromagnetic Spectrum and Wave Propagation

The **electromagnetic spectrum** ranges from radio waves (\( f \sim 10^4 \, \text{Hz} \)) to gamma rays (\( f \sim 10^{19} \, \text{Hz} \)), with wavelength \( \lambda = \frac{c}{f} \). Waves propagate with phase velocity \( v = \frac{\omega}{k} \), where \( k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \). JEE/NEET problems involve calculating frequency, wavelength, or identifying spectrum regions. *University Physics* connects the spectrum to applications like communication and medicine.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves a radio wave with frequency 100 MHz. Calculate its wavelength.
- **Solution**: Wavelength: \( \lambda = \frac{c}{f} \). Given \( f = 100 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz} \), \( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \): \( \lambda = \frac{3.00 \times 10^8}{100 \times 10^6} = 3.00 \, \text{m} \). This is a classic JEE spectrum problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Convert frequency to Hz; divide by \( c \). Common error: Incorrect unit conversion.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks which part of the electromagnetic spectrum includes visible light.
- **Solution**: Visible light lies in the spectrum with wavelengths **400–700 nm**. Option (a) “Visible (400–700 nm)” is correct. This is a typical NEET spectrum problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Memorize spectrum ranges; visible is 400–700 nm. Common error: Confusing with infrared or UV.

## 33.3 Energy and Intensity of Electromagnetic Waves

The **energy density** of an electromagnetic wave is \( u = \epsilon_0 E^2 = \frac{B^2}{\mu_0} \), with average density \( u_{\text{avg}} = \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_0 E_0^2 \). **Intensity** (\( I \)) is the power per unit area: \( I = c u_{\text{avg}} = \frac{1}{2} c \epsilon_0 E_0^2 \). JEE/NEET problems involve calculating intensity or energy flux. *Fundamentals of Physics* emphasizes energy transport in waves.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves an electromagnetic wave with electric field amplitude \( E_0 = 50 \, \text{V/m} \). Calculate the average intensity (\( \epsilon_0 = 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{C}^2/\text{N·m}^2 \)).
- **Solution**: Intensity: \( I = \frac{1}{2} c \epsilon_0 E_0^2 \). Given \( E_0 = 50 \, \text{V/m} \), \( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \): \( I = \frac{1}{2} \times 3.00 \times 10^8 \times 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \times 50^2 \approx \frac{1}{2} \times 3.00 \times 8.854 \times 10^{-4} \times 2500 \approx 3.320 \times 10^{-3} \times 2500 \approx 8.30 \, \text{W/m}^2 \). This is a standard JEE intensity problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Square \( E_0 \); multiply constants carefully. Common error: Omitting \( \frac{1}{2} \).

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks the unit of intensity for electromagnetic waves.
- **Solution**: Intensity is power per unit area, with unit **W/m²**. Option (a) “W/m²” is correct. This is a typical NEET energy problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Intensity units are W/m²; relate to power. Common error: Confusing with energy density.

## 33.4 Polarization of Electromagnetic Waves

**Polarization** describes the orientation of the electric field in a wave. **Plane-polarized** waves have \( \vec{E} \) in a fixed plane. Polarization occurs via polarizers, reducing intensity by \( I = I_0 \cos^2 \theta \) (Malus’s law). JEE/NEET problems involve calculating polarized intensity or angles. *University Physics* connects polarization to optical devices.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves unpolarized light of intensity 20 W/m² passing through a polarizer, then a second polarizer at 30° to the first. Calculate the final intensity.
- **Solution**: First polarizer: \( I_1 = \frac{1}{2} I_0 = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \, \text{W/m}^2 \). Second polarizer (Malus’s law): \( I_2 = I_1 \cos^2 \theta = 10 \times \cos^2 30^\circ = 10 \times \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)^2 = 10 \times \frac{3}{4} = 7.5 \, \text{W/m}^2 \approx 7.50 \, \text{W/m}^2 \). This is a classic JEE polarization problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Halve unpolarized intensity; apply Malus’s law. Common error: Incorrect angle or cosine.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks the effect of a polarizer on unpolarized light.
- **Solution**: A polarizer reduces unpolarized light intensity by **half**, i.e., \( I = \frac{1}{2} I_0 \). Option (a) “Reduces intensity by half” is correct. This is a typical NEET polarization problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Polarizers halve unpolarized light; no polarization for unpolarized input. Common error: Assuming full transmission.

## Review & Summary
