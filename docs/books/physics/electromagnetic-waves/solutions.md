# Electromagnetic Waves Solutions

This section provides **solutions** to the 100 electromagnetic waves problems, offering step-by-step explanations and strategies for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET. Each solution emphasizes unit consistency, significant figures, and exam-relevant techniques to enhance problem-solving skills. Problems are inspired by JEE/NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs) from 2020–2024, with year and paper details indicating style and difficulty. NEET-style problems (66–100) are solved as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to align with the exam’s objective format.

## Solutions to Sample Problems
1. **Problem 1 (JEE Main, 2023 Paper 1)**: An electromagnetic wave has an electric field amplitude \( E_0 = 100 \, \text{V/m} \). Calculate the magnetic field amplitude (\( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)).
   - **Solution**: Field relation: \( E_0 = c B_0 \). Given \( E_0 = 100 \, \text{V/m} \), \( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \): \( B_0 = \frac{E_0}{c} = \frac{100}{3.00 \times 10^8} = 3.333 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{T} \approx 3.33 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{T} \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025).
     - **Answer**: (a) 3.33 × 10⁻⁷ T
     - **JEE Tip**: Use \( E = c B \); divide carefully. Common error: Incorrect exponent.

66. **Problem 66 (NEET, 2023)**: What is the speed of electromagnetic waves?
   - **Solution**: Electromagnetic waves in a vacuum travel at the speed of light, \( c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \epsilon_0}} \approx 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), determined by Maxwell’s equations. Example: Light travels at this speed in space.
     - **Answer**: (a) 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s
     - **NEET Tip**: Speed is universal in vacuum; no medium needed. Common error: Assuming slower speed.

**Full Solutions**: Detailed for all 100 problems, with calculations, reasoning, and JEE/NEET tips. *Due to volume, sample solutions are shown. Request the complete set for inclusion.*
