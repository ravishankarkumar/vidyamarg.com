# Magnetic Fields Due to Currents Solutions

This section provides **solutions** to the 100 magnetic fields due to currents problems, offering step-by-step explanations and strategies for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET. Each solution emphasizes unit consistency, significant figures, and exam-relevant techniques to enhance problem-solving skills. Problems are inspired by JEE/NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs) from 2020–2024, with year and paper details indicating style and difficulty. NEET-style problems (66–100) are solved as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to align with the exam’s objective format.

## Solutions to Sample Problems
1. **Problem 1 (JEE Main, 2023 Paper 1)**: A long straight wire carries 10 A. Calculate the magnetic field at 0.04 m (\( \mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{T·m/A} \)).
   - **Solution**: Field: \( B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r} \). Given \( I = 10 \, \text{A} \), \( r = 0.04 \, \text{m} \): \( B = \frac{4\pi \times 10^{-7} \times 10}{2\pi \times 0.04} = \frac{4 \times 10^{-6}}{0.08} = 5 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T} \approx 5.00 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T} \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025).
     - **Answer**: (b) 5.00 × 10⁻⁵ T
     - **JEE Tip**: Simplify constants; use right-hand rule for direction. Common error: Incorrect distance units.

66. **Problem 66 (NEET, 2023)**: What does the Biot-Savart law describe?
   - **Solution**: The Biot-Savart law describes the magnetic field produced by a current element, \( d\vec{B} \propto \frac{I d\vec{l} \times \hat{r}}{r^2} \). Example: A wire’s field is circular, proportional to current.
     - **Answer**: (a) Magnetic field
     - **NEET Tip**: Focus on field source; distinguish from Ampère’s law. Common error: Confusing with force laws.

**Full Solutions**: Detailed for all 100 problems, with calculations, reasoning, and JEE/NEET tips. *Due to volume, sample solutions are shown. Request the complete set for inclusion.*
