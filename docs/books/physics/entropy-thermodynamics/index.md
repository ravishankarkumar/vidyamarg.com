# Chapter 20: Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics

Entropy measures the disorder of a system, guiding the direction of energy transformations in thermodynamic processes. This chapter explores entropy and disorder, the second law of thermodynamics, entropy changes in reversible and irreversible processes, and the efficiency of heat engines and refrigerators. These concepts are critical for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET, appearing in problems on entropy calculations, Carnot cycles, and engine efficiency. With clear explanations, exam-focused examples, and robust problem-solving strategies, this chapter equips students to master thermodynamics in competitive exams, ensuring precision and conceptual clarity.

## 20.1 Entropy and Disorder

**Entropy** (\( S \)) quantifies the disorder or number of microstates in a system, with units J/K. The **second law** implies that total entropy of an isolated system increases in spontaneous processes. For a reversible process, entropy change is \( \Delta S = \frac{Q_{\text{rev}}}{T} \), where \( Q_{\text{rev}} \) is heat transferred at absolute temperature \( T \). In irreversible processes, entropy increases (\( \Delta S_{\text{universe}} > 0 \)). JEE/NEET problems involve calculating \( \Delta S \) for isothermal or isobaric processes. *Fundamentals of Physics* emphasizes entropy as a measure of unavailable energy.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves a system absorbing 600 J of heat at 300 K in a reversible isothermal process. Calculate the entropy change.
- **Solution**: Entropy change: \( \Delta S = \frac{Q_{\text{rev}}}{T} \). Given \( Q_{\text{rev}} = 600 \, \text{J} \), \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \): \( \Delta S = \frac{600}{300} = 2 \, \text{J/K} \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025). This is a standard JEE entropy problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Use absolute temperature (K); ensure \( Q_{\text{rev}} \) is reversible heat. Common error: Using Celsius or incorrect \( Q \).

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves 1 kg of water at 373 K losing 2260000 J of heat to become steam at 373 K (reversible). Calculate the entropy change.
- **Solution**: Entropy change: \( \Delta S = \frac{Q_{\text{rev}}}{T} \). Given \( Q_{\text{rev}} = -2260000 \, \text{J} \) (heat lost, negative), \( T = 373 \, \text{K} \): \( \Delta S = \frac{-2260000}{373} \approx -6058.981 \, \text{J/K} \approx -6060 \, \text{J/K} \) (3 significant figures). This is a typical NEET phase change entropy problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Use latent heat for phase change; note sign of \( Q \). Common error: Incorrect temperature or sign.

## 20.2 The Second Law of Thermodynamics

The **second law of thermodynamics** states that the total entropy of an isolated system or the universe increases in any spontaneous process (\( \Delta S_{\text{universe}} \geq 0 \)). It implies that heat cannot spontaneously flow from a colder to a hotter body without work, and not all heat can be converted to work in a cyclic process. The law governs the direction of processes, like gas expansion or heat transfer. JEE/NEET problems involve applying the second law to cycles or processes. *University Physics* connects the second law to irreversibility.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves a reversible process where a system gains 800 J of heat at 400 K and loses 500 J at 200 K. Calculate the total entropy change of the system.
- **Solution**: Total entropy change: \( \Delta S = \sum \frac{Q_{\text{rev}}}{T} \). Given \( Q_1 = 800 \, \text{J} \) at \( T_1 = 400 \, \text{K} \), \( Q_2 = -500 \, \text{J} \) at \( T_2 = 200 \, \text{K} \): \( \Delta S = \frac{800}{400} + \frac{-500}{200} = 2 - 2.5 = -0.5 \, \text{J/K} \) (3 significant figures). This is a classic JEE entropy balance problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Sum entropy changes; use absolute temperatures. Common error: Incorrect signs or temperatures.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks which process violates the second law of thermodynamics.
- **Solution**: The second law states \( \Delta S_{\text{universe}} \geq 0 \). A process where heat flows spontaneously from a cold to a hot body without work violates this, as it decreases total entropy. Option (a) “Heat flows from cold to hot without work” is correct. This is a typical NEET conceptual problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Identify processes reducing \( \Delta S_{\text{universe}} \). Common error: Assuming all processes are possible.

## 20.3 Entropy Changes in Reversible and Irreversible Processes

In **reversible processes**, entropy change is calculated as \( \Delta S = \int \frac{dQ_{\text{rev}}}{T} \). For **isothermal** processes, \( \Delta S = \frac{Q}{T} \); for **isobaric** heating, \( \Delta S = m c_p \ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right) \). In **irreversible processes**, the system’s entropy change is calculated as if reversible, but the universe’s entropy increases. JEE/NEET problems involve computing \( \Delta S \) for specific processes or cycles. *Fundamentals of Physics* highlights entropy’s role in process direction.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves 0.5 kg of water heated isobarically from 300 K to 400 K (\( c_p = 4186 \, \text{J/kg·K} \)). Calculate the entropy change.
- **Solution**: Entropy change: \( \Delta S = m c_p \ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right) \). Given \( m = 0.5 \, \text{kg} \), \( c_p = 4186 \, \text{J/kg·K} \), \( T_1 = 300 \, \text{K} \), \( T_2 = 400 \, \text{K} \): \( \frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{400}{300} = \frac{4}{3} \), \( \ln\left(\frac{4}{3}\right) \approx 0.287682 \), \( \Delta S = 0.5 \times 4186 \times 0.287682 \approx 602.092 \, \text{J/K} \approx 602 \, \text{J/K} \) (3 significant figures). This is a classic JEE isobaric entropy problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Use natural log; ensure temperatures in K. Common error: Using base-10 log or incorrect \( c_p \).

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves an irreversible process where 1000 J of heat is transferred from a 500 K reservoir to a 250 K reservoir. Calculate the entropy change of the universe.
- **Solution**: Universe entropy change: \( \Delta S_{\text{universe}} = \Delta S_{\text{hot}} + \Delta S_{\text{cold}} \). For hot reservoir, \( Q = -1000 \, \text{J} \), \( T = 500 \, \text{K} \): \( \Delta S_{\text{hot}} = \frac{-1000}{500} = -2 \, \text{J/K} \). For cold reservoir, \( Q = 1000 \, \text{J} \), \( T = 250 \, \text{K} \): \( \Delta S_{\text{cold}} = \frac{1000}{250} = 4 \, \text{J/K} \). Thus, \( \Delta S_{\text{universe}} = -2 + 4 = 2 \, \text{J/K} \) (3 significant figures). This is a typical NEET irreversible entropy problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Sum reservoir entropy changes; positive \( \Delta S_{\text{universe}} \) for irreversible. Common error: Incorrect signs or temperatures.

## 20.4 Heat Engines and Refrigerators

A **heat engine** converts heat into work via a cyclic process, absorbing heat \( Q_h \) from a hot reservoir (at \( T_h \)), performing work \( W \), and rejecting heat \( Q_c \) to a cold reservoir (at \( T_c \)). Efficiency: \( \eta = \frac{W}{Q_h} = 1 - \frac{Q_c}{Q_h} \). For a **Carnot engine**, \( \eta_{\text{Carnot}} = 1 - \frac{T_c}{T_h} \) (temperatures in K). A **refrigerator** transfers heat from a cold to a hot reservoir using work, with coefficient of performance \( \text{COP} = \frac{Q_c}{W} \). JEE/NEET problems involve calculating efficiency or COP. *University Physics* connects engines to practical applications like power plants.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem involves a Carnot engine operating between 600 K and 300 K. Calculate the efficiency.
- **Solution**: Carnot efficiency: \( \eta_{\text{Carnot}} = 1 - \frac{T_c}{T_h} \). Given \( T_h = 600 \, \text{K} \), \( T_c = 300 \, \text{K} \): \( \eta = 1 - \frac{300}{600} = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 \) or 50% (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025). This is a standard JEE efficiency problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Use Kelvin; efficiency is unitless. Common error: Using Celsius or incorrect ratio.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem involves a refrigerator extracting 400 J of heat from a cold reservoir at 200 K, using 100 J of work. Calculate the coefficient of performance.
- **Solution**: Coefficient of performance: \( \text{COP} = \frac{Q_c}{W} \). Given \( Q_c = 400 \, \text{J} \), \( W = 100 \, \text{J} \): \( \text{COP} = \frac{400}{100} = 4 \) (3 significant figures). This is a typical NEET refrigerator problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: COP is unitless; use given \( Q_c \) and \( W \). Common error: Using incorrect formula or temperatures.
