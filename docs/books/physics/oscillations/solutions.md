# Oscillations Solutions

This section provides **solutions** to the 100 oscillations problems, offering step-by-step explanations and strategies for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET. Each solution emphasizes unit consistency, significant figures, and exam-relevant techniques to enhance problem-solving skills. Problems are inspired by JEE/NEET Previous Year Questions (PYQs) from 2020–2024, with year and paper details indicating style and difficulty [Web:0, Web:8]. NEET-style problems (66–100) are solved as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to align with the exam’s objective format [Web:9, Web:15].

## Solutions to Sample Problems
1. **Problem 1 (JEE Main, 2023 Paper 1)**: A 0.4 kg mass on a spring (constant 160 N/m) oscillates. Calculate the period of oscillation.
   - **Solution**: Period: \( T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} \). Given \( m = 0.4 \, \text{kg} \), \( k = 160 \, \text{N/m} \): \( T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{0.4}{160}} = 2 \pi \sqrt{0.0025} = 2 \pi \times 0.05 \approx 6.2832 \times 0.05 \approx 0.31416 \, \text{s} \approx 0.31 \, \text{s} \) (2 significant figures, April 14, 2025).
     - **Answer**: (a) 0.31 s
     - **JEE Tip**: Simplify square root; use SI units. Common error: Forgetting \( 2 \pi \).

66. **Problem 66 (NEET, 2023)**: What characterizes simple harmonic motion?
   - **Solution**: SHM is periodic motion where the restoring force is proportional to displacement and opposite in direction (\( F = -k x \)). This leads to sinusoidal motion (e.g., \( x = A \sin(\omega t + \phi) \)). Example: A spring or pendulum exhibits SHM. Option (a) correctly describes this.
     - **Answer**: (a) Periodic motion with restoring force proportional to displacement
     - **NEET Tip**: Focus on SHM’s defining feature: proportional restoring force. Common error: Confusing with non-periodic motion.

**Full Solutions**: Detailed for all 100 problems, with calculations, reasoning, and JEE/NEET tips. *Due to volume, sample solutions are shown. Request the complete set for inclusion.*
