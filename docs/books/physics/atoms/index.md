# Chapter 40: All About Atoms

Atomic structure, describing how electrons orbit nuclei, forms the cornerstone of modern physics, enabling technologies like lasers and atomic clocks. This chapter explores early atomic models (Rutherford), Bohr’s model of the hydrogen atom, the quantum mechanical model with quantum numbers, and atomic spectra. These concepts are critical for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET, appearing in problems on energy levels, spectral lines, and quantum states. With clear explanations, exam-focused examples, and robust problem-solving strategies, this chapter equips students to master atomic physics in competitive exams, ensuring precision and conceptual clarity.

## 40.1 Early Atomic Models (Rutherford)

**Early atomic models** evolved from Thomson’s plum pudding model to **Rutherford’s nuclear model**, which proposed a dense, positively charged nucleus surrounded by orbiting electrons, based on the gold foil experiment. The model explained alpha particle scattering but failed to account for electron stability. JEE/NEET problems involve understanding scattering angles or model limitations. *Fundamentals of Physics* emphasizes Rutherford’s evidence for the nuclear atom.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem asks the outcome of Rutherford’s gold foil experiment.
- **Solution**: Most alpha particles passed through undeflected, but some were scattered at large angles, indicating a **dense, positive nucleus**. Option (a) “Dense nucleus” is correct. This is a standard JEE Rutherford problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Focus on scattering patterns; nucleus is small and dense. Common error: Assuming uniform charge distribution.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks the limitation of Rutherford’s model.
- **Solution**: Rutherford’s model failed to explain **electron stability**, as orbiting electrons should radiate energy and spiral into the nucleus. Option (a) “Electron instability” is correct. This is a typical NEET atomic model problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Relate to classical instability; Bohr addressed this. Common error: Ignoring electromagnetic radiation.

## 40.2 Bohr’s Model of the Hydrogen Atom

**Bohr’s model** quantized electron orbits in the hydrogen atom, with radius \( r_n = \frac{n^2 \hbar^2 \epsilon_0}{\pi m_e e^2} \approx 0.529 \times 10^{-10} n^2 \, \text{m} \) (Bohr radius for \( n = 1 \)) and energy levels \( E_n = -\frac{13.6}{n^2} \, \text{eV} \), where \( n \) is the principal quantum number. Transitions between levels emit or absorb photons with energy \( \Delta E = hf \). JEE/NEET problems involve calculating radii, energies, or photon wavelengths. *University Physics* connects Bohr’s model to spectral lines.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves a hydrogen electron transitioning from \( n = 3 \) to \( n = 2 \). Calculate the wavelength of the emitted photon (\( h = 4.136 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{eV·s} \), \( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)).
- **Solution**: Energy levels: \( E_n = -\frac{13.6}{n^2} \, \text{eV} \). For \( n = 3 \): \( E_3 = -\frac{13.6}{9} \approx -1.511 \, \text{eV} \). For \( n = 2 \): \( E_2 = -\frac{13.6}{4} = -3.4 \, \text{eV} \). Energy difference: \( \Delta E = E_3 - E_2 = -1.511 - (-3.4) = 1.889 \, \text{eV} \). Photon wavelength: \( \lambda = \frac{hc}{\Delta E} = \frac{4.136 \times 10^{-15} \times 3.00 \times 10^8}{1.889} \approx 6.566 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} = 656.6 \, \text{nm} \approx 657 \, \text{nm} \) (3 significant figures, April 14, 2025). This is a classic JEE Bohr problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Use energy difference; convert to nm. Common error: Incorrect \( n \) values.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks the energy of the ground state in hydrogen.
- **Solution**: Ground state (\( n = 1 \)): \( E_1 = -\frac{13.6}{1^2} = -13.6 \, \text{eV} \). Option (a) “-13.6 eV” is correct. This is a typical NEET Bohr problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Ground state is lowest energy; use \( n = 1 \). Common error: Assuming positive energy.

## 40.3 Quantum Mechanical Model and Quantum Numbers

The **quantum mechanical model** describes electrons with **wave functions** (orbitals), defined by four quantum numbers: principal (\( n \)), azimuthal (\( l \), 0 to \( n-1 \)), magnetic (\( m_l \), \(-l\) to \( l \)), and spin (\( m_s \), \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \)). The Pauli exclusion principle ensures no two electrons share identical quantum numbers. JEE/NEET problems involve determining quantum numbers or electron configurations. *Fundamentals of Physics* emphasizes orbitals over orbits.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Main problem asks the possible quantum numbers for an electron in the 3d orbital.
- **Solution**: For 3d: \( n = 3 \), \( l = 2 \). Possible \( m_l = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 \), \( m_s = \pm \frac{1}{2} \). Combinations: \( (3, 2, -2, +\frac{1}{2}), (3, 2, -2, -\frac{1}{2}), \ldots, (3, 2, 2, +\frac{1}{2}), (3, 2, 2, -\frac{1}{2}) \). Option (a) “\( n = 3, l = 2, m_l = -2, m_s = +\frac{1}{2} \)” is one valid set. This is a standard JEE quantum number problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: List all \( m_l \), \( m_s \); check Pauli exclusion. Common error: Incorrect \( l \) range.

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks the maximum number of electrons in the \( n = 2 \) shell.
- **Solution**: Maximum electrons: \( 2n^2 \). For \( n = 2 \): \( 2 \times 2^2 = 8 \). Option (a) “8 electrons” is correct. This is a typical NEET quantum number problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Use \( 2n^2 \); relate to shells. Common error: Confusing with subshells.

## 40.4 Atomic Spectra and Applications

**Atomic spectra** arise from electron transitions, producing line spectra (e.g., hydrogen’s Balmer series). The Rydberg formula is \( \frac{1}{\lambda} = R \left( \frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2} \right) \), where \( R \approx 1.097 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}^{-1} \). Applications include spectroscopy and atomic clocks. JEE/NEET problems involve calculating wavelengths or identifying spectral series. *University Physics* connects spectra to astrophysics and quantum technologies.

**Solved Example**: A JEE Advanced problem involves a hydrogen electron transitioning from \( n = 4 \) to \( n = 2 \). Calculate the wavelength using the Rydberg formula (\( R = 1.097 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}^{-1} \), \( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)).
- **Solution**: Rydberg formula: \( \frac{1}{\lambda} = R \left( \frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2} \right) \). Given \( n_1 = 2 \), \( n_2 = 4 \): \( \frac{1}{\lambda} = 1.097 \times 10^7 \left( \frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{4^2} \right) = 1.097 \times 10^7 \left( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{16} \right) = 1.097 \times 10^7 \times \frac{4 - 1}{16} = 1.097 \times 10^7 \times \frac{3}{16} \approx 2.056 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}^{-1} \). \( \lambda = \frac{1}{2.056 \times 10^6} \approx 4.864 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} = 486.4 \, \text{nm} \approx 486 \, \text{nm} \). This is a classic JEE spectra problem.
  - **JEE Tip**: Use Rydberg formula; convert to nm. Common error: Swapping \( n_1 \), \( n_2 \).

**Solved Example**: A NEET problem asks the series for hydrogen’s visible spectrum.
- **Solution**: The **Balmer series** (\( n_1 = 2 \), \( n_2 > 2 \)) produces visible light. Option (a) “Balmer series” is correct. This is a typical NEET spectra problem.
  - **NEET Tip**: Balmer is visible; memorize series ranges. Common error: Confusing with Lyman (UV).
